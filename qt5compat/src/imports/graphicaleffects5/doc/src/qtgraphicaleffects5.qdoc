    \brief The Qt Graphical Effects module is provided for compatibility with
    applications written for Qt 5.

    The \l{qtgraphicaleffects5-index.html}{Qt Graphical Effects} module provides a set of QML types for
    adding visually impressive and configurable effects to user
    interfaces. Effects are visual items that can be added to Qt Quick
    user interface as UI components.

    To use the types in this module, import the module with the following line:
    \qml
    import Qt5Compat.GraphicalEffects
    \endqml

    \note The Qt Graphical Effects module is provided for compatibility with
    applications written for Qt 5.

\title Qt 5 Compatibility APIs: Graphical Effects
\page qtgraphicaleffects5-index.html
\brief Qt Graphical Effects module is a Qt Quick Add-On module.

The Qt Graphical Effects module is provided for compatibility with
applications written for Qt 5. As far as practically feasible, effects
have been ported, but some dynamically generated effects are incompatible with
the approach to shader effects in Qt 6 and have thus been left out.

The Qt Graphical Effects module provides a set of QML types for adding visually
impressive and configurable effects to user interfaces. Effects are visual
items that can be added to Qt Quick user interface as UI components.

The API consists of over 15 effects provided as separate QML types. The effects
cover functional areas such as masking, blurring, coloring, and many more.

\section1 Getting Started
To load Qt Graphical Effects, add the following import statement to your .qml file:
\snippet FastBlur-example.qml import

To use the effects, simply add a specific effect declaration to the QML scene and
configure the effects properties. Effects have one or more source properties for
specifying the visual input for which the effect is applied to. The altered visual
output is then presented in the effect item itself. The source can be another,
often hidden, item in the QML scene. More complex effects can have multiple sources.
The source item type can be any QML type, even video or another effect. Pipelining
multiple effects together is a simple way to create even more impressive output.

Each effect has a set of properties that can be used to configure the effect output.
Properties can be animated just like any other QML properties. The QML type
documentation contains property descriptions and basic usage examples.

\note Effects are not available when running with the \c software
backend of Qt Quick.  For more information on Qt Quick scene graph
backends, see \l{qtquick-visualcanvas-adaptations.html}{Scene Graph
Adaptations}.
