    \title Changes to Qt SerialBus
    \ingroup changes-qt-5-to-6
    \brief Migrate Qt SerialBus to Qt 6.

    Qt 6 is a result of the conscious effort to make the framework more
    efficient and easy to use.
    We try to maintain binary and source compatibility for all the public
    APIs in each release. But some changes were inevitable in an effort to
    make Qt a better framework.
    In this topic, we summarize those changes in Qt SerialBus module and
    provide guidance to handle them.

    \section1 Changes overview
    The Qt SerialBus module is generally speaking source compatible with the
    Qt 5 version and users of the library should be able to continue with no or
    minor changes to their project.

    \section1 Build system
    As with Qt 6 in general, the Qt SerialBus module has CMake support in
    addition to qmake.

    \section1 API changes

    \section2 Qt CAN bus

    \section3 Removal of QCanBusFactoryV2
    In Qt 6 the QCanBusFactoryV2 has been removed and is no longer part of the
    public API. Instead QCanBusFactory has gained the additional method
    QCanBusFactory::availableDevices that needs to be implemented by sub-classes
    of QCanBusFactory.

    \section3 Changes to QCanBusDevice
    QCanBusDevice got the following changes:
    \list
        \li setConfigurationParameter() and configurationParameter() now use
            the distinct type ConfigurationKey instead int.
        \li The functions resetController(), hasBusStatus() and busStatus()
            are now virtual functions. They have been internal callbacks in
            Qt 5 due to binary compatibility.
        \li Custom plugins using one of the private API function
            QCanBusDevice::createDeviceInfo() need small adoptions as these
            functions now have the \c plugin name as first parameter and
            slighly adopted parameter lists.
    \endlist

    \section3 Changes to QCanBusFrame
    QCanBusFrame now uses the distinct type \c FrameId, which is a typedef
    to quint32, so existing code should still work. Anyway, it is recommended
    to use \c FrameId when upgrading.

    \section2 Qt Modbus

    \section3 Renaming of QModbusRtuSerialMaster and QModbusRtuSerialSlave
    Following the recommendation of the Modbus organization the class
    \c QModbusRtuSerialMaster has been renamed to \l QModbusRtuSerialClient and
    the class \c QModbusRtuSerialSlave has been renamed to \l QModbusRtuSerialServer.
    It is advised to use the new class names in new or ported code to adhere to
    the Modbus naming scheme.
