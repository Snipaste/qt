\title Qt Bluetooth
\brief Qt Bluetooth enables connectivity between Bluetooth enabled devices.
\ingroup technology-apis

The Bluetooth API provides connectivity between Bluetooth enabled devices.

Currently, the API is supported on the following platforms:

Qt 5.14 adds a native Win32 port supporting Classic Bluetooth on Windows 7 or newer,
and Bluetooth LE on Windows 8 or newer. It must be enabled at build time by configuration
option -native-win32-bluetooth. The UWP backend is used by default if this option is not
set and the Win32 target platform supports the required UWP APIs (minimal requirement is
Windows 10 version 1507, with slightly improved service discovery since Windows 10 version
1607).

\section1 Overview

Bluetooth is a short-range (less than 100 meters) wireless technology. It
has a reasonably high data transfer rate of 2.1 Mbit/s, which makes it ideal
for transferring data between devices. Bluetooth connectivity is based on
basic device management, such as scanning for devices, gathering information
about them, and exchanging data between them.

Qt Bluetooth supports Bluetooth Low Energy development for client/central role use cases.
Further details can be found in the
\l {Bluetooth Low Energy Overview}{Bluetooth Low Energy Overview} section.

\section2 Building Qt Bluetooth

Despite the fact that the module can be built for all Qt platforms,
the module is not ported to all of them. Not supported platforms
employ a fake or dummy backend which is automatically selected when the
platform is not supported. The dummy backend reports appropriate error messages
and values which allow the Qt Bluetooth developer to detect at runtime that the
current platform is not supported. The dummy backend is also selected on Linux if
BlueZ development headers are not found during build time or Qt was built without
Qt D-Bus support.

The usage of the dummy backend is highlighted via an appropriate warning while building and running.

\section3 \macos Specific
The Bluetooth API on \macos requires a certain type of event dispatcher
that in Qt causes a dependency to QGuiApplication. However, you can set the
environment variable \c {QT_EVENT_DISPATCHER_CORE_FOUNDATION=1} to circumvent
this issue.

Applications that don't use Classic Bluetooth will find a subset of QtBluetooth
is available, as CoreBluetooth (Bluetooth LE) do not require either of
QApplication or QGuiApplication.

\section2 Logging Categories

The \l QtBluetooth module exports the following
\l {Configuring Categories}{logging categories}:

\table
\header
    \li Logging Category
    \li Description
\row
    \li qt.bluetooth
    \li Enables logging of cross platform code path in QtBluetooth
\row
    \li qt.bluetooth.android
    \li Enables logging of the \l {Qt for Android} {Android} implementation
\row
    \li qt.bluetooth.bluez
    \li Enables logging of the BLuez/Linux implementation
\row
    \li qt.bluetooth.ios
    \li Enables logging of the \l {Qt for iOS} {iOS} implementation
\row
    \li qt.bluetooth.osx
    \li Enables logging of the \l {Qt for macOS} {macOS} implementation
\row
    \li qt.bluetooth.windows
    \li Enables logging of the \l {Qt for Windows} implementation
\endtable

Logging categories can be used to enable additional warning and debug output
for QtBluetooth. More detailed information about logging can be found in \l QLoggingCategory.
A quick way to enable all QtBluetooth logging is to add the following line to the \c main() function:

\code
    QLoggingCategory::setFilterRules(QStringLiteral("qt.bluetooth* = true"));
\endcode
