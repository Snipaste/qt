    \qmltype DirectionalLight
    \inherits Light
    \inqmlmodule QtQuick3D
    \brief Defines a directional light in the scene.

    The directional light emits light in one direction from an unidentifiable source located
    infinitely far away. This is similar to the way sunlight works in real life. A directional
    light has infinite range and does not diminish.

    If \l {Light::castsShadow}{castsShadow} is enabled, shadows will be parallel to the light
    direction.

    A directional light effectively have no position, so moving it does not
    have any effect. The light will always be emitted in the direction of the
    light's Z axis.

    Rotating the light along its X or Y axis will change the direction of the light emission.

    Scaling a directional light will only have an effect in the following cases:
    \list
    \li If Z scale is set to a negative number, the light will be emitted in the opposite direction.
    \li If the scale of any axis is set to 0, the light will be emitted along the world's Z axis.
    \note Rotating the light will then have no effect.
    \endlist

    Let's look at a simple example:

    \qml
    import QtQuick
    import QtQuick3D
    View3D {
        anchors.fill: parent

        PerspectiveCamera { z: 600 }

        DirectionalLight {
        }

        Model {
            source: "#Sphere"
            scale: Qt.vector3d(4, 4, 4)
            materials: PrincipledMaterial {
                baseColor: "#40c060"
                roughness: 0.1 // make specular highlight visible
            }
        }
    }
    \endqml

    Here the DirectionalLight uses the default \c white color, emitting in the
    direction of the DirectionalLight node's Z axis.

    \image directionallight-1.png

    Rotating 60 degrees around the X axis would lead to the following. Instead
    of emitting straight in the direction of the Z axis, the light is now
    pointing 60 degrees "down":

    \qml
    DirectionalLight {
        eulerRotation.x: 30
    }
    \endqml

    \image directionallight-2.png

    For further usage examples, see \l{Qt Quick 3D - Lights Example}.
