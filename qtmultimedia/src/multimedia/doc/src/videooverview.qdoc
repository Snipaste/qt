\title Video Overview
\brief Video playback

\section1 Video Features

Qt Multimedia offers both high and low level C++ classes for playing and
manipulating video data, and QML types for playback and recording. Some
of the classes presented here overlap with what is presented in the \l {Camera Overview} and
\l {Audio Overview}.

\section1 Video Implementation Details

\target multimedia-playing-video
\section2 Playing Video in C++

You can use the \l QMediaPlayer class to decode a video file, and display
it using \l QVideoWidget, \l QGraphicsVideoItem, or a custom class.

Here's an example of using QVideoWidget:
    \snippet multimedia-snippets/video.cpp Video widget

And an example with QGraphicsVideoItem:
    \snippet multimedia-snippets/video.cpp Video graphics item

\section2 Playing Video in QML

You can use \l VideoOutput to render content that is provided by
either a \l MediaPlayer or a \l Camera. The VideoOutput is a visual
component that can be embedded into a QQuickScene or \l Window, while
all media decoding and playback control is handled by the \l MediaPlayer
or \l CaptureSession. A \l Video element has been provided for convenience.
It combines MediaPlayer, VideoOutput and AudioOutput elements in one item.

\section2 Working with Low Level Video Frames

Qt Multimedia offers a number of low level classes to make handling
video frames a bit easier. These classes are primarily used when
writing code that processes video or camera frames (for example,
detecting barcodes, or applying a fancy vignette effect), or needs
to display video in a special way that is otherwise unsupported.

The \l QVideoFrame class encapsulates a video frame and allows the
contents to be mapped into system memory for manipulation or
processing. Using your own QVideoSink
allows you to receive these frames from \l QMediaPlayer and
\l QCamera.

\section2 Recording Video
The central class for any type of capturing or recording of audio and video is QMediaCaptureSession
(or the CaptureSession QML type). You can connect a QCamera (Camera in QML) and a QMediaRecorder
(MediaRecorder)to the session and then ask the media recorder to start recording.

\section1 Supported Media Formats

What media formats are supported ultimately depends on the configuration of the
target system.

\section2 Windows
By default what is available on a MS Windows target depends on the version of
\l{Windows Media Player} that was packaged with the OS. See the
\l{Windows Media Player documentation} for official information.

Independent of Windows Media Player, there are of course numerous codec packs
that could be installed. See the \l{codec guide} site for some examples.

\section2 Android
See \l{Android supported media formats} for this information.

\section2 Linux
On Linux this is about installing the correct \l{GStreamer} plugins.

\section3 Minimum Required GStreamer Plugins
\list
\li gstreamer1.0-plugins-base
\li gstreamer1.0-plugins-good
\li gstreamer1.0-plugins-pulseaudio
\endlist

For a Linux desktop target, it is strongly recommended to have \c gstreamer1.0-libav
for good codec coverage and \c gstreamer1.0-vaapi to get hardware acceleration.

On embedded Linux, the required set of plugins could be somewhat different.

\section2 Determining Supported Media Formats at Runtime
You can determine what formats are available on a target system at runtime using
the static QMediaFormat API.

\list
\li Use \l QMediaFormat::isSupported() on a QMediaFormat::ConversionMode to query a
    specific format.
\li Use \l QMediaFormat::supportedFileFormats() on a default constructed QMediaFormat
    to get all the supported file formats.
\endlist

\section1 Examples

There are both C++ and QML examples available.
