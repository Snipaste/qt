    \title Qt Multimedia
    \image noun_Media_166644.svg "image of multimedia icons, courtesy of misirlou from the Noun Project"
    \brief The Qt Multimedia module provides APIs for playing back and recording
    audiovisual content

    Qt Multimedia is an add-on module that provides a rich set of QML types
    and C++ classes to handle multimedia content. It contains an easy to use
    API for playing back audio and video files and rendering those on screen, as
    well as a comprehensive API for recording audio and video from the systems
    cameras and microphones.

    The functionality of this module is divided into the following submodules:

    \table
     \row
      \li \l{Multimedia Overview}{Qt Multimedia}
      \li Provides API for multimedia-specific use cases.
     \row
      \li \l{Qt Multimedia Widgets}
      \li Provides the widget-based multimedia API.
    \endtable

    \section1 Getting started
    If you are porting from Qt 5 to Qt 6 see \l{Changes to Qt Multimedia}.

    If you are new to Qt Multimedia, the QML types can be
    \l{qtqml import syntax}{imported} into an application using the following
    statement in your \c {.qml} file.

    \qml
     import QtMultimedia
    \endqml

    If you want to use the C++ classes in your application, include the C++
    definitions using the following directive:

    \code
      #include <QtMultimedia>
      #include <QtMultimediaWidgets>
    \endcode

    \note If you are using a few classes from this module, we recommend
    including those specific classes only instead of the module.

    To link against the C++ libraries, add the following to your project's
    \c CMakeLists.txt file. Substitute \c my_project with the name of your
    project.

   \code
        find_package(Qt6 COMPONENTS Multimedia REQUIRED)
        target_link_libraries(my_project PUBLIC Qt::Multimedia)
   \endcode

     \endlist

    \section1 QML Types

    The following table outlines some important QML types.

    \table
    \header
     \li Type
     \li Description
    \row
     \li \l{MediaPlayer}
     \li Add audio/video playback functionality to a scene.
    \row
     \li \l {QtMultimedia::CaptureSession}{CaptureSession}
     \li Create a session for capturing audio/video.
    \row
     \li \l {QtMultimedia::Camera}{Camera}
     \li Access a camera connected to the system.
    \row
     \li \l {QtMultimedia::AudioInput}{AudioInput}
     \li Access an audio input (microphone) connected to the system.
    \row
     \li \l {QtMultimedia::AudioOutput}{AudioOutput}
     \li Access an audio output (speaker, headphone) connected to the system.
    \row
     \li \l {QtMultimedia::VideoOutput}{VideoOutput}
     \li Display video content.
    \row
     \li \l {QtMultimedia::MediaRecorder}{MediaRecorder}
     \li Record audio/video from the CaptureSession.
    \row
     \li \l {QtMultimedia::ImageCapture}{ImageCapture}
     \li Capture still images from the Camera.
    \row
     \li \l {QtMultimedia::Video}{Video}
     \li Add Video playback functionality to a scene. Uses MediaPlayer and
     VideoOutput types to provide video playback functionality.
    \endtable

    \section1 C++ Classes

    The following table outlines some important C++ Classes

    \table
    \header
     \li Class
     \li Description
    \row
     \li QMediaPlayer
     \li Playback media from a source.
    \row
     \li QVideoWidget
     \li Display video from a media player or a capture session.
    \row
     \li QMediaCaptureSession
     \li Capture audio and video.
    \row
     \li QCamera
     \li Access a camera connected to the system
    \row
     \li QAudioInput
     \li Access an audio input (microphone) connected to the system.
    \row
     \li QAudioOutput
     \li Access an audio output (speaker, headphone) connected to the system.
    \row
     \li QImageCapture
     \li Capture still images with a camera.
    \row
     \li QMediaRecorder
     \li Record media content from a capture session.
    \row
     \li QVideoSink
     \li Access and render individual video frames.
    \row
     \li QAudioSink
     \li Sends raw audio data to an audio output device.
    \endtable

    For playback QMediaPlayer, QAudioOutput and QVideoOutput contain all the required functionality.
    The other classes are used for capturing audio and video content, where the QMediaCaptureSession is the central
    class managing the whole capture/recording process.

    \section1 Licenses and attributions

    The Qt Quick Multimedia module is available under commercial licenses from
    \l{The Qt Company}.
    In addition, it is available under free software licenses. Since Qt 5.6,
    these free software licenses are
    \l{GNU Lesser General Public License, version 3}, or
    the \l{GNU General Public License, version 2}.
    See \l{Qt Licensing} for further details.

    \section2 Platform notes

    For most features, Qt Multimedia builds upon the multimedia framework of the
    underlying operating system. Therefore there are several multimedia back ends
    based on different technologies and APIs.

    While we try to support our full API on all platforms, platform specific limitations do
    exist in a few places. This is due to the fact that the feature set supported by those
    frameworks varies, implying that some functionality
    might not be available on all platforms. This is especially true for the set of
    supported file formats and codecs, as well as advanced camera functionality.

    Where limitations exist, we aim to document those in the respective classes and
    methods.
