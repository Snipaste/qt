    \fn QPlatformImageCapture::isReadyForCapture() const

    Identifies if a capture control is ready to perform a capture
    immediately (all the resources necessary for image capture are allocated,
    hardware initialized, flash is charged, etc).

    Returns true if the camera is ready for capture; and false if it is not.

    It's permissible to call capture() while the camera status is QCamera::ActiveStatus
    regardless of isReadyForCapture property value.
    If camera is not ready to capture image immediately,
    the capture request is queued with all the related camera settings
    to be executed as soon as possible.

    Signals that a capture control's \a ready state has changed.

/*!
    \fn QPlatformImageCapture::capture(const QString &fileName)

    Initiates the capture of an image to \a fileName.
    The \a fileName can be relative or empty,
    in this case the service should use the system specific place
    and file naming scheme.

    The Camera service should save all the capture parameters
    like exposure settings or image processing parameters,
    so changes to camera parameters after capture() is called
    do not affect previous capture requests.

    Returns the capture request id number, which is used later
    with imageExposed(), imageCaptured() and imageSaved() signals.
*/

/*!
    \fn QPlatformImageCapture::imageExposed(int requestId)

    Signals that an image with it \a requestId
    has just been exposed.
    This signal can be used for the shutter sound or other indicaton.
*/

    has been captured and a \a preview is available.

/*!
    \fn QPlatformImageCapture::imageMetadataAvailable(int id, const QMediaMetaData &metaData)

    Signals that a metadata for an image with request \a id is available.

    This signal should be emitted between imageExposed and imageSaved signals.
*/

/*!
    \fn QPlatformImageCapture::imageAvailable(int requestId, const QVideoFrame &buffer)

    Signals that a captured \a buffer with a \a requestId is available.
*/

/*!
    \fn QPlatformImageCapture::imageSaved(int requestId, const QString &fileName)

    Signals that a captured image with a \a requestId has been saved
    to \a fileName.
*/

/*!
    \fn QPlatformImageCapture::imageSettings() const

    Returns the currently used image encoder settings.

    The returned value may be different than passed to setImageSettings()
