    \class QMediaDevices
    \brief The QMediaDevices class provides information about available
    multimedia input and output devices.
    \ingroup multimedia
    \inmodule QtMultimedia

    The QMediaDevices class provides information about the available multimedia
    devices and the system defaults. It monitors the following three groups:
    \list
    \li Audio input devices (Microphones)
    \li Audio output devices (Speakers, Headsets)
    \li Video input devices (Cameras)
    \endlist

    QMediaDevices provides a separate list for each device group. If it detects that a
    new device has been connected to the system or an attached device has been disconnected
    from the system, it will update the corresponding device list and emit a signal
    notifying about the change.

    QMediaDevices monitors the system defaults for each device group. It will notify about
    any changes done through the system settings. For example, if the user selects a new
    default audio output in the system settings, QMediaDevices will update the default audio
    output accordingly and emit a signal. If the system does not provide a default for a
    camera or an audio input, QMediaDevices will select the first device from the list as
    the default device.

    While using the default input and output devices is often sufficient for
    playing back or recording multimedia, there is often a need to explicitly
    select the device to be used.

    QMediaDevices is a singleton object and all getters are thread-safe.

    The MediaDevices type provides information about the available multimedia
    devices and the system defaults. It monitors the following three groups:

    While using the default input and output devices is often sufficient for
    playing back or recording multimedia, there is often a need to explicitly
    select the device to be used.

    For example, the snippet below will ensure that the media player always uses
    the systems default audio output device for playback:
