    \e{Media Player} demonstrates a simple multimedia player that can play
    audio and or video files using various codecs.

    \include examples-run.qdocinc

    The example uses a QMediaPlayer object passed into a QVideoWidget to
    control the video output. To give the application playlist capability
    we also use a QPlayList object.

    To activate the various functions such as play and stop on the dialog,
    the button clicked events emit the play() and stop() signals, which
    are connected to the play() and stop() slots of QMediaPlayer.

    \code
        connect(controls, SIGNAL(play()), player, SLOT(play()));
        connect(controls, SIGNAL(pause()), player, SLOT(pause()));
        connect(controls, SIGNAL(stop()), player, SLOT(stop()));
    \endcode

    We can get the volume (and set our user interface representation)

    \code
        controls->setVolume(player->volume());
    \endcode

    and we can make widget 'volume' changes change the volume

    \code
        connect(controls, SIGNAL(changeVolume(int)), player, SLOT(setVolume(int)));
    \endcode

    The example also allows us to change video properties by means
    of the QVideoWidget object. We can go to Full Screen mode with a single
    button click, and back again.
