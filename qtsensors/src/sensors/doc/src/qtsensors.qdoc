    \title Qt Sensors
    \brief Provides access to sensors via QML and C++ interfaces.
    \since 5.1

    The Qt Sensors API provides access to sensor hardware via QML and C++ interfaces.

    Currently the API is supported on \l{Qt for Android}{Android},
    \l{Qt for iOS}{iOS}, and \l {Qt for Windows}{Windows (MSVC)}.

    \section1 Information for Application Writers

    Applications can access Qt Sensors using QML or C++.

    To include the definitions of the module's classes, use the following directive:

    \code
    #include <QtSensors>
    \endcode

    To import the QML types into your application, use the following import statement
    in your .qml file:

    \qml
    import QtSensors
    \endqml

    To link against the module:

    Using cmake:
    \include qtsensors-module-use.qdocinc cmakebuild

    Using qmake:
    \include qtsensors-module-use.qdocinc qmakebuild
