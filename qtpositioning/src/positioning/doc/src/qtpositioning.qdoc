\title Qt Positioning
\brief The Qt Positioning API provides positioning information via QML and C++ interfaces.
\ingroup technology-apis

The Qt Positioning API provides positioning information via QML and C++ interfaces.

Currently the API is supported on \l {Qt for Android}{Android},
\l {Qt for iOS}{iOS}, \l {Qt for macOS}{\macos}, \l {Qt for Linux/X11}{Linux},
and \l {Qt for Windows}{Windows} (with GPS receivers exposed as a serial port
providing NMEA sentences or using \c {Windows.Devices.Geolocation}).

\section1 Overview

The Qt Positioning API gives developers the ability to determine a position by
using a variety of possible sources, including satellite, or wifi, or text file,
and so on. That information can then be used to for example determine a position
on a map. In addition satellite information can be retrieved and area based monitoring
can be performed.

\include module-use.qdocinc using qt module

\badcode
find_package(Qt6 COMPONENTS Positioning REQUIRED)
target_link_libraries(mytarget PRIVATE Qt6::Positioning)
\endcode

See also the \l {Build with CMake} overview.

\include module-use.qdocinc building with qmake

\badcode
QT += positioning
\endcode

\section2 Getting Started

To load the Qt Positioning module, add the following statement to your .qml files

\snippet doc_src_qtpositioning.qml import

For C++ projects include the header appropriate for the current use case,
for example applications using routes may use

\code
#include <QGeoCoordinate>
\endcode

\section1 Module Evolution

\l {Changes to Qt Positioning} lists important changes in the module API and
functionality that were done for the Qt 6 series of Qt.

\section1 Licenses

Qt Positioning is available under commercial licenses from \l{The Qt Company}.
In addition, it is available under free software licenses. Since Qt 5.4,
these free software licenses are
\l{GNU Lesser General Public License, version 3}, or
the \l{GNU General Public License, version 2}.
