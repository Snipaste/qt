    \qmltype Location
    \inqmlmodule QtPositioning
    \since 5.2

    \brief The Location type holds location data.

    Location types represent a geographic "location", in a human sense. This
    consists of a specific \l {coordinate}, an \l {address} and a
    \l {boundingShape}{bounding shape}.
    The \l {boundingShape}{bounding shape} represents the recommended region
    to display when viewing this location.

    The Location type is most commonly seen as the contents of a search
    model such as the GeocodeModel. When a GeocodeModel returns the list of
    locations found for a given query, it represents these as Location objects.

    \section2 Example Usage

    The following example shows a simple Location object being declared:

    \code
    Location {
        coordinate {
            latitude: -27.3
            longitude: 153.1
        }
        address: Address {
            ...
        }
    }
    \endcode
*/

/*!
    \qmlproperty VariantMap QDeclarativeGeoLocation::extendedAttributes

    This property holds the extended attributes for this Location.
    Extended attributes are backend-dependent and can be location-dependent.

    \since 5.13
*/

    For details on how to use this property to interface between C++ and QML see
    "\l {Location - QGeoLocation} {Interfaces between C++ and QML Code}".

    \note This property updates the whole geo location information, so using it
    will result in breaking of all the bindings for all other properties.

    \qmlproperty geoshape QtPositioning::Location::boundingShape

    This property holds the recommended region to use when displaying the location.
    For example, a building's location may have a region centered around the building,
    but the region is large enough to show it's immediate surrounding geographical
    context.

    \note This property's changed() signal is currently emitted only if the
    whole object changes, not if only the contents of the object change.

    \note This property was introduced in Qt6 instead of boundingBox property.
    It returns a \l geoshape instead of a \l georectangle.
    Use \l QGeoShape::boundingGeoRectangle() to obtain a bounding
    \l georectangle for the shape.

    If you need to convert the returned shape to a specific type, use the
    \c type property of \l geoshape together with convenience
    methods from \l [QML]{QtPositioning} like
    \l {QtPositioning::shapeToRectangle}{QtPositioning.shapeToRectangle()}.
