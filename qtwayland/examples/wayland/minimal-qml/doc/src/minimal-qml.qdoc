 * \title Qt Wayland Compositor Examples - Minimal QML
 * \example minimal-qml
 * \brief Minimal QML is a simple example that demonstrates how to write a Wayland compositor in QML.
 * \ingroup qtwaylandcompositor-examples
 *
 * Minimal QML is a desktop-style Wayland compositor example implementing a
 * complete Qt Wayland Compositor with as little code as possible. The compositor is implemented
 * with Qt Quick and QML.
 *
 * \image minimal-qml.png
 *
 * \section1 The WaylandCompositor Object
 *
 * The top-level item of the compositor is a \l WaylandCompositor. This represents the Wayland
 * server itself and manages the connections to clients as they come in.
 *
 * \snippet minimal-qml/main.qml compositor
 *
 * By default, the server supports the core Wayland protocol for communicating with clients.
 * Usually, though, you will also want to support one or more extensions to the protocol. This
 * gives the client more tools to influence its role in the windowing system.
 *
 * Qt supports several standard and common extensions. In addition, it is easy to create and support
 * custom extensions, as long as support can be added in both the client and server code.
 *
 * \section1 Shell Extensions
 *
 * Typically, a compositor will support at least one
 * \l{Shell Extensions - Qt Wayland Compositor}{shell extension}. Extensions are added to
 * the compositor by instantiating them as direct children of the \l WaylandCompositor object. They
 * will automatically be added to its \c extensions property and broadcast to clients when they
 * connect.
 *
 * \snippet minimal-qml/main.qml shells
 *
 * The \e{Minimal QML} example supports three different shells: \l{WlShell}, \l{XdgShell} and
 * \l{IviApplication}.
 *
 * A client can connect to either of these and it will be used as a channel for communicating
 * about certain things between the client and compositor, such as creating new windows,
 * negotiating size, and so on.
 *
 * When a client creates a new surface, its active extension will receive a signal of this. The
 * signal contains a \l ShellSurface argument. Depending on which extension received the signal,
 * this argument will be of a subclass of \l{ShellSurface}: \l{WlShellSurface}, \l{XdgSurface}
 * or \l{IviSurface} respectively.
 *
 * The \l ShellSurface can be used to access features of the shell extension for the specific
 * surface. In the \e{Minimal QML} example, we simply want to add the client to our scene. To
 * record existence of the new window, we add it to a simple \l ListModel for safe-keeping.
 *
 * \snippet minimal-qml/main.qml model
 *
 * \section1 Creating the Scene
 *
 * Most of the necessary compositor code is already ready. The final step is to make sure
 * applications are actually visible on the screen.
 *
 * For all compositors, we have to define at least one output. This is done by instantiating
 * a \l WaylandOutput object as the direct child of the \l WaylandCompositor. If there is only
 * a single output, this will represent the primary screen on the system. (You may also create
 * multiple \l WaylandOutput objects to address multiple screens if they are available. See
 * the \l{Qt Wayland Compositor Examples - Multi Screen}{Multi Screen example} for more details
 * about this.)
 *
 * \snippet minimal-qml/main.qml output
 *
 * Inside the \l{WaylandOutput}, we create a \l Window that serves as the container for
 * our scene. In the example, we give this a size. The size used if the compositor is running as
 * an application inside another windowing system which supports custom-sized windows. In a
 * typical use case on an embedded device, where the compositor is the only display server running,
 * it will probably be running on a full-screen platform plugin (such as \c{eglfs}) and the size
 * set here will not matter.
 *
 * The final step is to create items for each of the \l ShellSurface objects that have been created.
 * For this, we can use the \l ShellSurfaceItem class.
 *
 * \snippet minimal-qml/main.qml shell surface item
 *
 * We create a \l ShellSurfaceItem for each of the shell surfaces in our model, and assign them
 * to the \c shellSurface property. In addition, we make sure the model is updated when the shell
 * surface is destroyed. This can happen when a client manually closes a window, and if it exits
 * or crashes.
 *
 * And this is all the code needed to create a functional Wayland compositor using Qt Quick and
 * QML. For another example of a compositor written in QML but which has a few more features, take
 * a look at the \l{Qt Wayland Compositor Examples - Pure QML}{Pure QML example}.
