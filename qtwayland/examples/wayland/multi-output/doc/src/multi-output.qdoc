    \title Qt Wayland Compositor Examples - Multi Output
    \example multi-output
    \brief Multi Output is an example that demonstrates a compositor with multiple outputs.
    \ingroup qtwaylandcompositor-examples

    \section1 Introduction

    The Multi Output example demonstrates how to display the same clients on different
    \l{WaylandOutput}{WaylandOutputs} with different types of composition. One output shows
    the clients in a uniform grid, scaled to the same size. The other output is a normal
    desktop-style interactive compositor window.

    For an introduction to the basic principles of creating a \l{Qt Wayland Compositor} with Qt,
    see the \l{Qt Wayland Compositor Examples - Minimal QML}{Minimal QML example}.

    \section1 Multiple Outputs

    The example creates two different windows, one for each output. For the grid view, we connect to the
    \l{WaylandCompositor::surfaceRequested}{surfaceRequested} signal. This signal is emitted for every
    surface that the client creates. This allows the application to override the default response to the request
    and create a custom \l{WaylandSurface}.

    \snippet multi-output/qml/main.qml onSurfaceRequested

    Upon receiving the signal, the example creates a \l WaylandQuickItem as a view of the surface.
    This can be added to the Qt Quick scene like any other item. In the example, we add it to
    a \l{GridView}.

    For the desktop-style window, we use the features of the \l XdgShell extension.
    When the surface has been created, the \l XdgShell emits a
    \l{XdgShell::toplevelCreated}{toplevelCreated} signal.

    \snippet multi-output/qml/main.qml xdgshell

    We create a \l ShellSurfaceItem to add the \l XdgToplevel to the second output. This enables
    desktop-style interaction with the surface.

    When these steps are done, the client's contents are visible in both windows. The buffers
    containing the client's contents are the same for both the outputs, but are visualized in two
    different ways, and provide different ways for the user to interact with them.

    \note In order to support multiple Wayland outputs in the same compositor, the
    \l Qt::AA_ShareOpenGLContexts attribute must be set before the \l QGuiApplication
    object is constructed.
