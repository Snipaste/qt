    \title macOS Style

    The macOS style is a style that looks native on macOS.
    \l {detailed-desc-macOS}{More...}

    \styleimport {QtQuick.Controls.macOS} {Qt 6.0}

    \target detailed-desc-macOS

    The macOS style is a style that looks native on macOS. The controls are drawn run-time using
    native frameworks, and is therefore only available for applications running on macOS.

    \note Be aware that the apperance of this style can change from one minor Qt version to the
    next, to better blend in with native applications on the platform.

    To run an application with the macOS style, see
    \l {Using Styles in Qt Quick Controls}.

    \section2 Current state

    The macOS style is under development, and some controls are not yet supported. Those
    controls are: \l BusyIndicator, \l DelayButton, \l PageIndicator, \l RangeSlider, \l Switch, \l TabBar and
    \l Tumbler. Those will fall back to use the \l {Fusion Style}.

    \section2 Customization

    The goal of the macOS style is to for the controls look and feel as similar as possible to the
    native controls in UIKit. The style will follow the theme and colors configured globally from
    System Preferences, and does not come with a separate customization API on top of that.

    \note The macOS style is not suitable for \l {Customizing Qt Quick Controls}{customizing}.
    The main reason is that it sometimes draw both the contents and the background
    onto a single background item, which will not look good together with a custom contentItem.
    It also tends to use padding and inset values that are different from the other styles.
