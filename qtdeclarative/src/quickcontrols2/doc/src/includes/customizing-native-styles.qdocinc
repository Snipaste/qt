It is instead recommended to always base a customized control on top of a single style
that is available on all platforms, e.g \l {Basic Style}, \l {Fusion Style}, \l {Imagine Style},
\l {Material Style}, \l {Universal Style}. By doing so, you are guaranteed that it will
always look the same, regardless of which style the application is run with. For example:

\code
    import QtQuick.Controls.Basic as Basic

    Basic.SpinBox {
        background: Rectangle { /* ... */ }
    }
\endcode
