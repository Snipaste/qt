    \brief QQmlAnyBinding is an abstraction over the various bindings in QML

    QQmlAnyBinding can store both classical bindings (derived from QQmlAbstractBinding)
    as well as new-style bindings (derived from QPropertyBindingPrivate). For both, it keeps
    a strong reference to them, and knows how to delete them in case the reference count
    becomes zero. In that sense it can be thought of as a union of QUntypedPropertyBinding
    and QQmlAbstractBinding::Ptr.

    It also offers methods to create bindings (from QV4::Function, from translation bindings
    and from code strings). Moreover, it allows the retrieval, the removal and the
    installation of bindings on a QQmlProperty.

    Note that the class intentionally does not allow construction from QUntypedProperty and
    QQmlAbstractBinding::Ptr. This is meant to catch code which doesn't handle bindable properties
    yet when porting existing code.
