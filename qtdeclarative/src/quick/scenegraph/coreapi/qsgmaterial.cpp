/*!
    \class QSGMaterial
    \brief The QSGMaterial class encapsulates rendering state for a shader program.
    \inmodule QtQuick
    \ingroup qtquick-scenegraph-materials

    QSGMaterial and QSGMaterialShader subclasses form a tight relationship. For
    one scene graph (including nested graphs), there is one unique
    QSGMaterialShader instance which encapsulates the shaders the scene graph
    uses to render that material, such as a shader to flat coloring of
    geometry. Each QSGGeometryNode can have a unique QSGMaterial containing the
    how the shader should be configured when drawing that node, such as the
    actual color to used to render the geometry.

    QSGMaterial has two virtual functions that both need to be implemented. The
    function type() should return a unique instance for all instances of a
    specific subclass. The createShader() function should return a new instance
    of QSGMaterialShader, specific to that subclass of QSGMaterial.

    A minimal QSGMaterial implementation could look like this:
    \code
        class Material : public QSGMaterial
        {
        public:
            QSGMaterialType *type() const override { static QSGMaterialType type; return &type; }
            QSGMaterialShader *createShader(QSGRendererInterface::RenderMode) const override { return new Shader; }
        };
    \endcode

    See the \l{Scene Graph - Custom Material}{Custom Material example} for an introduction
    on implementing a QQuickItem subclass backed by a QSGGeometryNode and a custom
    material.

    \note createShader() is called only once per QSGMaterialType, to reduce
    redundant work with shader preparation. If a QSGMaterial is backed by
    multiple sets of vertex and fragment shader combinations, the implementation
    of type() must return a different, unique QSGMaterialType pointer for each
    combination of shaders.

    \note All classes with QSG prefix should be used solely on the scene graph's
    rendering thread. See \l {Scene Graph and Rendering} for more information.

    For many materials, the typical approach will be to return a pointer to a
    static, and so globally available, QSGMaterialType instance. The
    QSGMaterialType is an opaque object. Its purpose is only to serve as a
    type-safe, simple way to generate unique material identifiers.
    \code
        QSGMaterialType *type() const override
        {

    \fn QSGMaterialShader *QSGMaterial::createShader(QSGRendererInterface::RenderMode renderMode) const

    This function returns a new instance of a the QSGMaterialShader
    implementation used to render geometry for a specific implementation
    of QSGMaterial.

    The function will be called only once for each combination of material type and \a renderMode
    and will be cached internally.

    For most materials, the \a renderMode can be ignored. A few materials may need
    custom handling for specific render modes. For instance if the material implements
    antialiasing in a way that needs to account for perspective transformations when
    RenderMode3D is in use.
