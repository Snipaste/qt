/*
    This is needed for QuickTestUtils. Q_AUTOTEST_EXPORT checks QT_BUILDING_QT
    (amongst others) to see if it should export symbols. Until QuickTestUtils
    was introduced, this was enough, as there weren't any intermediate test
    helper libraries that used a Qt library and were in turn used by tests.

    Taking QQuickItemViewPrivate as an example: previously it was using
    Q_AUTOTEST_EXPORT. Since QuickTestUtils is a Qt library (albeit a private
    one), QT_BUILDING_QT was true and so Q_AUTOTEST_EXPORT evaluated to an
    export. However, QQuickItemViewPrivate was already exported by the Quick
    library, so we would get errors like this:

    Qt6Quickd.lib(Qt6Quickd.dll) : error LNK2005: "public: static class
    QQuickItemViewPrivate * __cdecl QQuickItemViewPrivate::get(class QQuickItemView *)"
    (?get@QQuickItemViewPrivate@@SAPEAV1@PEAVQQuickItemView@@@Z) already defined
    in Qt6QuickTestUtilsd.lib(viewtestutils.cpp.obj)

    So, to account for the special case of QuickTestUtils, we need to be more
    specific about which part of Qt we're building; instead of checking if we're
    building any Qt library at all, check if we're building the Quick library,
    and only then export.
