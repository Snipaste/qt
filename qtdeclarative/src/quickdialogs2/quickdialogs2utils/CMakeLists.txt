# This library exists because QuickDialogs2 and QuickDialogs2QuickImpl
# both need QQuickNameFilter. QQuickNameFilter was originally in
# QuickDialogs2. Since QuickDialogs2 already links to
# QuickDialogs2QuickImpl, making the latter link to the former (to get
# access to QQuickNameFilter) would result in a circular dependency,
# so we have this library as a result.
