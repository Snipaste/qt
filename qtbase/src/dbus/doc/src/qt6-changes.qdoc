    \title Changes to Qt D-Bus
    \ingroup changes-qt-5-to-6
    \brief Migrate Qt DBus to Qt 6.

    Qt 6 is a result of the conscious effort to make the framework more
    efficient and easy to use.

    We try to maintain binary and source compatibility for all the public
    APIs in each release. But some changes were inevitable in an effort to
    make Qt a better framework.

    In this topic we summarize those changes in Qt DBus, and provide
    guidance to handle them.

    \section1 API changes

    The QtDBus module has undergone some basic consolidation and
    cleanup. There should be minimal porting effort to be able to switch to Qt6.

    \section2 The QDBusMessage class
    The QDBusMessage::call() and QDBusMessage::asyncCall() methods with a fixed
    size of arguments have been removed in Qt6.

    \section2 The QDBusArgument class
    The QDBusArgument::operator<<() specializations for QHash, QMap and QList
    have been unified into common specializations for associative containers.

    \section2 The QDBusConnection class
    The QDBusConnection::sender() function has been removed in Qt6.

    \section2 The QDBusMessage class
    The QDBusMessage::createErrorReply() function now takes the QString \c name
    argument by const reference instead of taking by value.

    \section2 The QDBusPendingReply class
    QDBusPendingReply has been changed to be a variadic template class in order
    to support more than 8 template parameters now. The template parameters
    are the types that will be used to extract the contents of the reply's data.
