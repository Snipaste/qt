    \title Qt Test
    \brief Provides classes for unit testing Qt applications and libraries.

    The Qt Test module provides classes for unit testing Qt applications and
    libraries. All public methods are in the \l QTest namespace. In addition,
    the \l QSignalSpy class provides easy introspection for Qt's signals and
    slots, and the \l QAbstractItemModelTester allows for non-destructive
    testing of item models.

    \note There is no binary compatibility guarantee for the Qt Test module.
          This means that an application that uses Qt Test is only guaranteed
          to work with the Qt version it was developed against. However, source
          compatibility is guaranteed.
