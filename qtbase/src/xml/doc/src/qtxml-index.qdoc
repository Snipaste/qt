    \title Qt XML
    \brief The Qt XML module provides C++ implementations of the SAX and DOM standards for XML.


    The Qt XML module provides implementations of the SAX and DOM standards for
    XML.

    \note Qt XML will no longer receive additional features. For reading or
    writing XML documents iteratively (SAX), use the QXmlStreamReader and
    QXmlStreamWriter classes. The classes are both easier to use and more
    compliant with the XML standard.

    The \l{Qt XML C++ Classes} page gives an overview over the available classes
    in this module.
