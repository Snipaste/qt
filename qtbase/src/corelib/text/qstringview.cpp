    \class QStringView
    \inmodule QtCore
    \since 5.10
    \brief The QStringView class provides a unified view on UTF-16 strings with a read-only subset of the QString API.
    \reentrant
    \ingroup tools
    \ingroup string-processing

    A QStringView references a contiguous portion of a UTF-16 string it does
    not own. It acts as an interface type to all kinds of UTF-16 string,
    without the need to construct a QString first.

    The UTF-16 string may be represented as an array (or an array-compatible
    data-structure such as QString,
    std::basic_string, etc.) of QChar, \c ushort, \c char16_t or
    (on platforms, such as Windows, where it is a 16-bit type) \c wchar_t.

    QStringView is designed as an interface type; its main use-case is
    as a function parameter type. When QStringViews are used as automatic
    variables or data members, care must be taken to ensure that the referenced
    string data (for example, owned by a QString) outlives the QStringView on all code paths,
    lest the string view ends up referencing deleted data.

    When used as an interface type, QStringView allows a single function to accept
    a wide variety of UTF-16 string data sources. One function accepting QStringView
    thus replaces three function overloads (taking QString and
    \c{(const QChar*, int)}), while at the same time enabling even more string data
    sources to be passed to the function, such as \c{u"Hello World"}, a \c char16_t
    string literal.

    QStringViews should be passed by value, not by reference-to-const:
    \snippet code/src_corelib_text_qstringview.cpp 0

    If you want to give your users maximum freedom in what strings they can pass
    to your function, accompany the QStringView overload with overloads for

    \list
        \li \e QChar: this overload can delegate to the QStringView version:
            \snippet code/src_corelib_text_qstringview.cpp 1
            even though, for technical reasons, QStringView cannot provide a
            QChar constructor by itself.
        \li \e QString: if you store an unmodified copy of the string and thus would
            like to take advantage of QString's implicit sharing.
        \li QLatin1String: if you can implement the function without converting the
            QLatin1String to UTF-16 first; users expect a function overloaded on
            QLatin1String to perform strictly less memory allocations than the
            semantically equivalent call of the QStringView version, involving
            construction of a QString from the QLatin1String.
    \endlist

    QStringView can also be used as the return value of a function. If you call a
    function returning QStringView, take extra care to not keep the QStringView
    around longer than the function promises to keep the referenced string data alive.
    If in doubt, obtain a strong reference to the data by calling toString() to convert
    the QStringView into a QString.

    QStringView is a \e{Literal Type}, but since it stores data as \c{char16_t}, iteration
    is not \c constexpr (casts from \c{const char16_t*} to \c{const QChar*}, which is not
    allowed in \c constexpr functions). You can use an indexed loop and/or utf16() in
    \c constexpr contexts instead.
