\summary {Compiles big binary resources into object code.}

\section1 Synopsis

\badcode
qt_add_big_resources(<VAR> file1.qrc [file2.qrc ...]
                     [OPTIONS ...])
\endcode

\versionlessCMakeCommandsNote qt6_add_big_resources()

\section1 Description

Creates compiled object files from Qt resource files using the
\l{Resource Compiler (rcc)}. Paths to the generated files are added to
\c{<VAR>}.

This is similar to \l qt_add_resources, but directly
generates object files (\c .o, \c .obj) files instead of C++ source code.
This allows to embed bigger resources, where compiling to C++ sources and then
to binaries would be too time consuming or memory intensive.

\note This macro is only available if using \c{CMake} 3.9 or later.

\section1 Arguments

You can set additional \c{OPTIONS} that should be added to the \c{rcc} calls.
You can find possible options in the \l{rcc}{rcc documentation}.
