\section1 Synopsis

\badcode
qt_finalize_target(target)
\endcode

\versionlessCMakeCommandsNote qt6_finalize_target()

\section1 Description

After a target is created, further processing or \e{finalization} steps are
sometimes needed. The steps to perform depend on the platform, the type of
target, and on various properties of the target. These steps are expected to be
performed within the same directory scope as the one in which the \c{target}
was created, so this command should also be called from that same directory
scope.

This command is ordinarily invoked as part of a call to
\l{qt6_add_executable}{qt_add_executable()} or
\l{qt6_add_library}{qt_add_library()}. The timing of when that call takes
place and when it might need to be called explicitly by a project is discussed
in the documentation of those commands.

\sa {qt6_set_finalizer_mode}{qt_set_finalizer_mode()}

\section1 Executable Targets

For executable targets, \c{qt_finalize_target()} implements the logic described
in the subsections below, as appropriate for the platform and target provided.
Later Qt releases may expand finalization processing further.

\section2 All Platforms

Some internal processing is performed to facilitate automatic linking of Qt
plugins. This is especially important if using a statically built Qt or a
CMake version earlier than 3.21.

\section2 Android

\list
\li Generate a deployment settings file for the \c target.
\li Create a build target for generating an APK.
\endlist

\section2 WASM

Create \c{${target}.html} (a target-specific \c{wasm_shell.html} file),
\c{qtloader.js} and \c{qtlogo.svg} files in the \c{CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}.

\section2 iOS

Finalization attempts to provide sensible values for the following target
properties if they are not already set, and their corresponding \c{CMAKE_...}
variable is also not set:

\list
\li \c XCODE_ATTRIBUTE_DEVELOPMENT_TEAM
\li \c XCODE_ATTRIBUTE_PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER
\li \c MACOSX_BUNDLE_GUI_IDENTIFIER
\endlist

If required, the \l QT_NO_SET_XCODE_DEVELOPMENT_TEAM_ID variable can be used to
disable setting \c XCODE_ATTRIBUTE_DEVELOPMENT_TEAM, and the
\l QT_NO_SET_XCODE_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER variable can be used to disable setting
\c XCODE_ATTRIBUTE_PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER and \c MACOSX_BUNDLE_GUI_IDENTIFIER.

\section1 Library Targets

As of this Qt version, finalization for library targets does not perform any
processing. Future Qt versions may add finalization processing for libraries,
so you should ensure finalization is still invoked in the expected way.
