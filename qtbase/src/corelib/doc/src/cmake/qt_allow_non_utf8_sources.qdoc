\section1 Description

When building with some compilers for Windows, targets that link to a Qt library
will use flags that force the compiler to treat its source files as UTF-8. This
is currently implemented for Visual Studio and Intel compilers. You can disable
this behavior on a per-target basis by calling \c{qt_allow_non_utf8_sources()}
and passing the target as the argument.
