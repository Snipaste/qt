\section1 Description

Specifies a custom set of plugins to import. The optional arguments:
\c INCLUDE, \c EXCLUDE, \c INCLUDE_BY_TYPE, and \c EXCLUDE_BY_TYPE,
can be used more than once.

\list
\li \c INCLUDE -- can be used to specify a list of plugins to import.
\li \c EXCLUDE -- can be used to specify a list of plugins to exclude.
\li \c INCLUDE_BY_TYPE -- can be used to override the list of plugins to
       import for a certain plugin type.
\li \c EXCLUDE_BY_TYPE -- can be used to specify a plugin type to exclude;
       then no plugins of that type are imported.
\li \c NO_DEFAULT -- prevent the default plugins from being included
       automatically (for example, the default platform plugin).
\endlist

Qt provides plugin types such as \c imageformats, \c platforms,
and \c sqldrivers.

If the command isn't used the target automatically links against
a sane set of default plugins, for each Qt module that the target is linked
against. For more information, see
\l{CMake target_link_libraries Documentation}{target_link_libraries}.

Each plugin comes with a C++ stub file that automatically
initializes the plugin. Consequently, any target that links against a plugin
has this C++ file added to its \c SOURCES.

\note This command imports plugins from static Qt builds only.
On shared builds, it does nothing.

\section1 Examples

\snippet cmake-macros/examples.cmake qt_import_plugins

In the snippet above, the following occurs with the executable \c myapp:

\list
\li The \c Qt6::QCocoaIntegrationPlugin is imported into myapp.
\li The \c Qt6::QMinimalIntegrationPlugin plugin is
    excluded from being automatically imported into myapp.
\li The default list of plugins for \c imageformats is
    overridden to only include Qt6::QGifPlugin and Qt6::QJpegPlugin.
\li All \c sqldrivers plugins are excluded from automatic importing.
\endlist
