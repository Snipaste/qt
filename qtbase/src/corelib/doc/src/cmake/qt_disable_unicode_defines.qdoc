\section1 Description

In Qt 6, the \c UNICODE and \c{_UNICODE} compiler definitions are set by
default for targets that link against Qt modules. This is in line with the
qmake behavior, but it is a change compared to the CMake API behavior in Qt 5.
Calling \c{qt_disable_unicode_defines()} on a \c target prevents these compiler
definitions from being automatically set.
