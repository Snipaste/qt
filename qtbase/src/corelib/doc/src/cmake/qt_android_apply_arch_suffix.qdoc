\section1 Description

The CMake \c{SUFFIX} target property controls the suffix used on the file name
of the target's built binary. This command is a convenience for setting that
property to an architecture-specific value. This is useful when installing
multiple builds for different Android architectures into the same install
location, as it prevents the libraries for different architectures from
overwriting each other.
