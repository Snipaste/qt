    \brief Accelerated 2D/3D graphics API abstraction.

    The Qt Rendering Hardware Interface is an abstraction for hardware accelerated
    graphics APIs, such as, \l{https://www.khronos.org/opengl/}{OpenGL},
    \l{https://www.khronos.org/opengles/}{OpenGL ES},
    \l{https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/direct3d}{Direct3D},
    \l{https://developer.apple.com/metal/}{Metal}, and
    \l{https://www.khronos.org/vulkan/}{Vulkan}.

    Some of the main design goals are:

    \list

    \li Simple, minimal, understandable, extensible. Follow the proven path of the
    Qt Quick scenegraph.

    \li Aim to be a product - and in the bigger picture, part of a product (Qt) -
    that is usable out of the box both by internal (such as, Qt Quick) and,
    eventually, external users.

    \li Not a complete 1:1 wrapper for any of the underlying APIs. The feature set
    is tuned towards the needs of Qt's 2D and 3D offering (QPainter, Qt Quick, Qt
    3D Studio). Iterate and evolve in a sustainable manner.

    \li Intrinsically cross-platform, without reinventing: abstracting
    cross-platform aspects of certain APIs (such as, OpenGL context creation and
    windowing system interfaces, Vulkan instance and surface management) is not in
    scope here. These are delegated to the existing QtGui facilities (QWindow,
    QOpenGLContext, QVulkanInstance) and its backing QPA architecture.

    \endlist

    Each QRhi instance is backed by a backend for a specific graphics API. The
    selection of the backend is a run time choice and is up to the application
    or library that creates the QRhi instance. Some backends are available on
    multiple platforms (OpenGL, Vulkan, Null), while APIs specific to a given
    platform are only available when running on the platform in question (Metal
    on macOS/iOS/tvOS, Direct3D on Windows).

    The available backends currently are:

    \list

    \li OpenGL 2.1 or OpenGL ES 2.0 or newer. Some extensions are utilized when
    present, for example to enable multisample framebuffers.

    \li Direct3D 11.1

    \li Metal

    \li Vulkan 1.0, optionally with some extensions that are part of Vulkan 1.1

    \li Null - A "dummy" backend that issues no graphics calls at all.

    \endlist

    In order to allow shader code to be written once in Qt applications and
    libraries, all shaders are expected to be written in a single language
    which is then compiled into SPIR-V. Versions for various shading language
    are then generated from that, together with reflection information (inputs,
    outputs, shader resources). This is then packed into easily and efficiently
    serializable QShader instances. The compilers and tools to generate such
    shaders are not part of QRhi, but the core classes for using such shaders,
    QShader and QShaderDescription, are.

    \section2 Design Fundamentals

    A QRhi cannot be instantiated directly. Instead, use the create()
    function. Delete the QRhi instance normally to release the graphics device.

    \section3 Resources

    Instances of classes deriving from QRhiResource, such as, QRhiBuffer,
    QRhiTexture, etc., encapsulate zero, one, or more native graphics
    resources. Instances of such classes are always created via the \c new
    functions of the QRhi, such as, newBuffer(), newTexture(),
    newTextureRenderTarget(), newSwapChain().

    \badcode
        vbuf = rhi->newBuffer(QRhiBuffer::Immutable, QRhiBuffer::VertexBuffer, sizeof(vertexData));
        if (!vbuf->create()) { error }
        ...
        delete vbuf;
    \endcode

    \list

    \li The returned value from functions like newBuffer() is always owned by
    the caller.

    \li Just creating a QRhiResource subclass never allocates or initializes any
    native resources. That is only done when calling the \c create() function of a
    subclass, for example, QRhiBuffer::create() or QRhiTexture::create().

    \li The exceptions are
    QRhiTextureRenderTarget::newCompatibleRenderPassDescriptor(),
    QRhiSwapChain::newCompatibleRenderPassDescriptor(), and
    QRhiRenderPassDescriptor::newCompatibleRenderPassDescriptor(). There is no
    \c create() operation for these and the returned object is immediately
    active.

    \li The resource objects themselves are treated as immutable: once a
    resource has create() called, changing any parameters via the setters, such as,
    QRhiTexture::setPixelSize(), has no effect, unless the underlying native
    resource is released and \c create() is called again. See more about resource
    reuse in the sections below.

    \li The underlying native resources are scheduled for releasing by the
    QRhiResource destructor, or by calling QRhiResource::destroy(). Backends
    often queue release requests and defer executing them to an unspecified
    time, this is hidden from the applications. This way applications do not
    have to worry about releasing native resources that may still be in use by
    an in-flight frame.

    \li Note that this does not mean that a QRhiResource can freely be
    destroy()'ed or deleted within a frame (that is, in a
    \l{QRhiCommandBuffer::beginFrame()}{beginFrame()} -
    \l{QRhiCommandBuffer::endFrame()}{endFrame()} section). As a general rule,
    all referenced QRhiResource objects must stay unchanged until the frame is
    submitted by calling \l{QRhiCommandBuffer::endFrame()}{endFrame()}. To ease
    this, QRhiResource::deleteLater() is provided as a convenience.

    \endlist

    \section3 Command buffers and deferred command execution

    Regardless of the design and capabilities of the underlying graphics API,
    all QRhi backends implement some level of command buffers. No
    QRhiCommandBuffer function issues any native bind or draw command (such as,
    \c glDrawElements) directly. Commands are always recorded in a queue,
    either native or provided by the QRhi backend. The command buffer is
    submitted, and so execution starts only upon QRhi::endFrame() or
    QRhi::finish().

    The deferred nature has consequences for some types of objects. For example,
    writing to a dynamic buffer multiple times within a frame, in case such
    buffers are backed by host-visible memory, will result in making the
    results of all writes are visible to all draw calls in the command buffer
    of the frame, regardless of when the dynamic buffer update was recorded
    relative to a draw call.

    Furthermore, instances of QRhiResource subclasses must be treated immutable
    within a frame in which they are referenced in any way. Create
    all resources upfront, before starting to record commands for the next
    frame. Reusing a QRhiResource instance within a frame (by calling \c create()
    then referencing it again in the same \c{beginFrame - endFrame} section)
    should be avoided as it may lead to unexpected results, depending on the
    backend.

    As a general rule, all referenced QRhiResource objects must stay valid and
    unmodified until the frame is submitted by calling
    \l{QRhiCommandBuffer::endFrame()}{endFrame()}. On the other hand, calling
    \l{QRhiResource::destroy()}{destroy()} or deleting the QRhiResource are
    always safe once the frame is submitted, regardless of the status of the
    underlying native resources (which may still be in use by the GPU - but
    that is taken care of internally).

    Unlike APIs like OpenGL, upload and copy type of commands cannot be mixed
    with draw commands. The typical renderer will involve a sequence similar to
    the following: \c{(re)create resources} - \c{begin frame} - \c{record
    uploads and copies} - \c{start renderpass} - \c{record draw calls} - \c{end
    renderpass} - \c{end frame}. Recording copy type of operations happens via
    QRhiResourceUpdateBatch. Such operations are committed typically on
    \l{QRhiCommandBuffer::beginPass()}{beginPass()}.

    When working with legacy rendering engines designed for OpenGL, the
    migration to QRhi often involves redesigning from having a single \c render
    step (that performs copies and uploads, clears buffers, and issues draw
    calls, all mixed together) to a clearly separated, two phase \c prepare -
    \c render setup where the \c render step only starts a renderpass and
    records draw calls, while all resource creation and queuing of updates,
    uploads and copies happens beforehand, in the \c prepare step.

    QRhi does not at the moment allow freely creating and submitting command
    buffers. This may be lifted in the future to some extent, in particular if
    compute support is introduced, but the model of well defined
    \c{frame-start} and \c{frame-end} points, combined with a dedicated,
    "frame" command buffer, where \c{frame-end} implies presenting, is going to
    remain the primary way of operating since this is what fits Qt's various UI
    technologies best.

    \section3 Threading

    A QRhi instance and the associated resources can be created and used on any
    thread but all usage must be limited to that one single thread. When
    rendering to multiple QWindows in an application, having a dedicated thread
    and QRhi instance for each window is often advisable, as this can eliminate
    issues with unexpected throttling caused by presenting to multiple windows.
    Conceptually that is then the same as how Qt Quick scene graph's threaded
    render loop operates when working directly with OpenGL: one thread for each
    window, one QOpenGLContext for each thread. When moving onto QRhi,
    QOpenGLContext is replaced by QRhi, making the migration straightforward.

    When it comes to externally created native objects, such as OpenGL contexts
    passed in via QRhiGles2NativeHandles, it is up to the application to ensure
    they are not misused by other threads.

    Resources are not shareable between QRhi instances. This is an intentional
    choice since QRhi hides most queue, command buffer, and resource
    synchronization related tasks, and provides no API for them. Safe and
    efficient concurrent use of graphics resources from multiple threads is
    tied to those concepts, however, and is thus a topic that is currently out
    of scope, but may be introduced in the future.

    \note The Metal backend requires that an autorelease pool is available on
    the rendering thread, ideally wrapping each iteration of the render loop.
    This needs no action from the users of QRhi when rendering on the main
    (gui) thread, but becomes important when a separate, dedicated render
    thread is used.

    \section3 Resource synchronization

    QRhi does not expose APIs for resource barriers or image layout
    transitions. Such synchronization is done implicitly by the backends, where
    applicable (for example, Vulkan), by tracking resource usage as necessary.
    Buffer and image barriers are inserted before render or compute passes
    transparently to the application.

    \note Resources within a render or compute pass are expected to be bound to
    a single usage during that pass. For example, a buffer can be used as
    vertex, index, uniform, or storage buffer, but not a combination of them
    within a single pass. However, it is perfectly fine to use a buffer as a
    storage buffer in a compute pass, and then as a vertex buffer in a render
    pass, for example, assuming the buffer declared both usages upon creation.

    \note Textures have this rule relaxed in certain cases, because using two
    subresources (typically two different mip levels) of the same texture for
    different access (one for load, one for store) is supported even within the
    same pass.

    \section3 Resource reuse

    From the user's point of view a QRhiResource is reusable immediately after
    calling QRhiResource::destroy(). With the exception of swapchains, calling
    \c create() on an already created object does an implicit \c destroy(). This
    provides a handy shortcut to reuse a QRhiResource instance with different
    parameters, with a new native graphics object underneath.

    The importance of reusing the same object lies in the fact that some
    objects reference other objects: for example, a QRhiShaderResourceBindings
    can reference QRhiBuffer, QRhiTexture, and QRhiSampler instances. If in a
    later frame one of these buffers need to be resized or a sampler parameter
    needs changing, destroying and creating a whole new QRhiBuffer or
    QRhiSampler would invalidate all references to the old instance. By just
    changing the appropriate parameters via QRhiBuffer::setSize() or similar
    and then calling QRhiBuffer::create(), everything works as expected and
    there is no need to touch the QRhiShaderResourceBindings at all, even
    though there is a good chance that under the hood the QRhiBuffer is now
    backed by a whole new native buffer.

    \badcode
        ubuf = rhi->newBuffer(QRhiBuffer::Dynamic, QRhiBuffer::UniformBuffer, 256);
        ubuf->create();

        srb = rhi->newShaderResourceBindings()
        srb->setBindings({
            QRhiShaderResourceBinding::uniformBuffer(0, QRhiShaderResourceBinding::VertexStage | QRhiShaderResourceBinding::FragmentStage, ubuf)
        });
        srb->create();

        ...

        // now in a later frame we need to grow the buffer to a larger size
        ubuf->setSize(512);
        ubuf->create(); // same as ubuf->destroy(); ubuf->create();

        // that's it, srb needs no changes whatsoever
    \endcode

    \section3 Pooled objects

    In addition to resources, there are pooled objects as well, such as,
    QRhiResourceUpdateBatch. An instance is retrieved via a \c next function,
    such as, nextResourceUpdateBatch(). The caller does not own the returned
    instance in this case. The only valid way of operating here is calling
    functions on the QRhiResourceUpdateBatch and then passing it to
    QRhiCommandBuffer::beginPass() or QRhiCommandBuffer::endPass(). These
    functions take care of returning the batch to the pool. Alternatively, a
    batch can be "canceled" and returned to the pool without processing by
    calling QRhiResourceUpdateBatch::destroy().

    A typical pattern is thus:

    \badcode
        QRhiResourceUpdateBatch *resUpdates = rhi->nextResourceUpdateBatch();
        ...
        resUpdates->updateDynamicBuffer(ubuf, 0, 64, mvp.constData());
        if (!image.isNull()) {
            resUpdates->uploadTexture(texture, image);
            image = QImage();
        }
        ...
        QRhiCommandBuffer *cb = m_sc->currentFrameCommandBuffer();
        cb->beginPass(swapchain->currentFrameRenderTarget(), clearCol, clearDs, resUpdates);
    \endcode

    \section3 Swapchain specifics

    QRhiSwapChain features some special semantics due to the peculiar nature of
    swapchains.

    \list

    \li It has no \c create() but rather a QRhiSwapChain::createOrResize().
    Repeatedly calling this function is \b not the same as calling
    QRhiSwapChain::destroy() followed by QRhiSwapChain::createOrResize(). This
    is because swapchains often have ways to handle the case where buffers need
    to be resized in a manner that is more efficient than a brute force
    destroying and recreating from scratch.

    \li An active QRhiSwapChain must be released by calling
    \l{QRhiSwapChain::destroy()}{destroy()}, or by destroying the object, before
    the QWindow's underlying QPlatformWindow, and so the associated native
    window object, is destroyed. It should not be postponed because releasing
    the swapchain may become problematic (and with some APIs, like Vulkan, is
    explicitly disallowed) when the native window is not around anymore, for
    example because the QPlatformWindow got destroyed upon getting a
    QWindow::close(). Therefore, releasing the swapchain must happen whenever
    the targeted QWindow sends the
    QPlatformSurfaceEvent::SurfaceAboutToBeDestroyed event. If the event does
    not arrive before the destruction of the QWindow - this can happen when
    using QCoreApplication::quit() -, then check QWindow::handle() after the
    event loop exits and invoke the swapchain release when non-null (meaning
    the underlying native window is still around).

    \endlist

    \section3 Ownership

    The general rule is no ownership transfer. Creating a QRhi with an already
    existing graphics device does not mean the QRhi takes ownership of the
    device object. Similarly, ownership is not given away when a device or
    texture object is "exported" via QRhi::nativeHandles() or
    QRhiTexture::nativeHandles(). Most importantly, passing pointers in structs
    and via setters does not transfer ownership.

    \section2 Troubleshooting

    Errors are printed to the output via qWarning(). Additional debug messages
    can be enabled via the following logging categories. Messages from these
    categories are not printed by default unless explicitly enabled via
    QRhi::EnableProfiling or the facilities of QLoggingCategory (such as, the
    \c QT_LOGGING_RULES environment variable).

    \list
    \li \c{qt.rhi.general}
    \endlist

    It is strongly advised to inspect the output with the logging categories
    (\c{qt.rhi.*}) enabled whenever a QRhi-based application is not behaving as
    expected.

/*!
    \enum QRhi::Flag
    Describes what special features to enable.

    \value EnableProfiling Enables gathering timing (CPU, GPU) and resource
    (QRhiBuffer, QRhiTexture, etc.) information and additional metadata. See
    QRhiProfiler. Avoid enabling in production builds as it may involve a
    performance penalty. Also enables debug messages from the \c{qt.rhi.*}
    logging categories.

    \value EnableDebugMarkers Enables debug marker groups. Without this frame
    debugging features like making debug groups and custom resource name
    visible in external GPU debugging tools will not be available and functions
    like QRhiCommandBuffer::debugMarkBegin() will become a no-op. Avoid
    enabling in production builds as it may involve a performance penalty.

    \value PreferSoftwareRenderer Indicates that backends should prefer
    choosing an adapter or physical device that renders in software on the CPU.
    For example, with Direct3D there is typically a "Basic Render Driver"
    adapter available with \c{DXGI_ADAPTER_FLAG_SOFTWARE}. Setting this flag
    requests the backend to choose that adapter over any other, as long as no
    specific adapter was forced by other backend-specific means. With Vulkan
    this maps to preferring physical devices with
    \c{VK_PHYSICAL_DEVICE_TYPE_CPU}. When not available, or when it is not
    possible to decide if an adapter/device is software-based, this flag is
    ignored. It may also be ignored with graphics APIs that have no concept and
    means of enumerating adapters/devices.

    \value EnablePipelineCacheDataSave Enables retrieving the pipeline cache
    contents, where applicable. When not set, pipelineCacheData() will return
    an empty blob always. Opting in is relevant in particular with backends
    where additional, potentially time consuming work is needed to maintain the
    data structures with the serialized, binary versions of shader programs. An
    example is OpenGL, where the "pipeline cache" is simulated by retrieving
    and loading shader program binaries. With backends where retrieving and
    restoring the pipeline cache contents is not supported, the flag has no
    effect. With some backends (such as, OpenGL) there are additional,
    disk-based caching mechanisms for shader binaries. Writing to those may get
    disabled whenever this flag is set since storing program binaries (OpenGL)
    to multiple caches is not sensible.
 */

/*!
    \enum QRhi::FrameOpResult
    Describes the result of operations that can have a soft failure.

    \value FrameOpSuccess Success

    \value FrameOpError Unspecified error

    \value FrameOpSwapChainOutOfDate The swapchain is in an inconsistent state
    internally. This can be recoverable by attempting to repeat the operation
    (such as, beginFrame()) later.

    \value FrameOpDeviceLost The graphics device was lost. This can be
    recoverable by attempting to repeat the operation (such as, beginFrame())
    after releasing and reinitializing all objects backed by native graphics
    resources. See isDeviceLost().
 */

/*!
    \enum QRhi::Feature
    Flag values to indicate what features are supported by the backend currently in use.

    \value MultisampleTexture Indicates that textures with a sample count larger
    than 1 are supported. In practice this feature will be unsupported with
    OpenGL ES versions older than 3.1, and OpenGL older than 3.0.

    \value MultisampleRenderBuffer Indicates that renderbuffers with a sample
    count larger than 1 are supported. In practice this feature will be
    unsupported with OpenGL ES 2.0, and may also be unsupported with OpenGL 2.x
    unless the relevant extensions are present.

    \value DebugMarkers Indicates that debug marker groups (and so
    QRhiCommandBuffer::debugMarkBegin()) are supported.

    \value Timestamps Indicates that command buffer timestamps are supported.
    Relevant for QRhiProfiler::gpuFrameTimes().

    \value Instancing Indicates that instanced drawing is supported. In
    practice this feature will be unsupported with OpenGL ES 2.0 and OpenGL
    3.2 or older.

    \value CustomInstanceStepRate Indicates that instance step rates other
    than 1 are supported. In practice this feature will always be unsupported
    with OpenGL. In addition, running with Vulkan 1.0 without
    VK_EXT_vertex_attribute_divisor will also lead to reporting false for this
    feature.

    \value PrimitiveRestart Indicates that restarting the assembly of
    primitives when encountering an index value of 0xFFFF
    (\l{QRhiCommandBuffer::IndexUInt16}{IndexUInt16}) or 0xFFFFFFFF
    (\l{QRhiCommandBuffer::IndexUInt32}{IndexUInt32}) is enabled, for certain
    primitive topologies at least. QRhi will try to enable this with all
    backends, but in some cases it will not be supported. Dynamically
    controlling primitive restart is not possible since with some APIs
    primitive restart with a fixed index is always on. Applications must assume
    that whenever this feature is reported as supported, the above mentioned
    index values \c may be treated specially, depending on the topology. The
    only two topologies where primitive restart is guaranteed to behave
    identically across backends, as long as this feature is reported as
    supported, are \l{QRhiGraphicsPipeline::LineStrip}{LineStrip} and
    \l{QRhiGraphicsPipeline::TriangleStrip}{TriangleStrip}.

    \value NonDynamicUniformBuffers Indicates that creating buffers with the
    usage \l{QRhiBuffer::UniformBuffer}{UniformBuffer} and the types
    \l{QRhiBuffer::Immutable}{Immutable} or \l{QRhiBuffer::Static}{Static} is
    supported. When reported as unsupported, uniform (constant) buffers must be
    created as \l{QRhiBuffer::Dynamic}{Dynamic}. (which is recommended
    regardless)

    \value NonFourAlignedEffectiveIndexBufferOffset Indicates that effective
    index buffer offsets (\c{indexOffset + firstIndex * indexComponentSize})
    that are not 4 byte aligned are supported. When not supported, attempting
    to issue a \l{QRhiCommandBuffer::drawIndexed()}{drawIndexed()} with a
    non-aligned effective offset may lead to unspecified behavior. Relevant in
    particular for Metal, where this will be reported as unsupported.

    \value NPOTTextureRepeat Indicates that the
    \l{QRhiSampler::Repeat}{Repeat} wrap mode and mipmap filtering modes are
    supported for textures with a non-power-of-two size. In practice this can
    only be false with OpenGL ES 2.0 implementations without
    \c{GL_OES_texture_npot}.

    \value RedOrAlpha8IsRed Indicates that the
    \l{QRhiTexture::RED_OR_ALPHA8}{RED_OR_ALPHA8} format maps to a one
    component 8-bit \c red format. This is the case for all backends except
    OpenGL when using either OpenGL ES or a non-core profile context. There
    \c{GL_ALPHA}, a one component 8-bit \c alpha format, is used
    instead. Using the special texture format allows having a single code
    path for creating textures, leaving it up to the backend to decide the
    actual format, while the feature flag can be used to pick the
    appropriate shader variant for sampling the texture.

    \value ElementIndexUint Indicates that 32-bit unsigned integer elements are
    supported in the index buffer. In practice this is true everywhere except
    when running on plain OpenGL ES 2.0 implementations without the necessary
    extension. When false, only 16-bit unsigned elements are supported in the
    index buffer.

    \value Compute Indicates that compute shaders, image load/store, and
    storage buffers are supported. OpenGL older than 4.3 and OpenGL ES older
    than 3.1 have no compute support.

    \value WideLines Indicates that lines with a width other than 1 are
    supported. When reported as not supported, the line width set on the
    graphics pipeline state is ignored. This can always be false with some
    backends (D3D11, Metal). With Vulkan, the value depends on the
    implementation. With OpenGL, wide lines are not supported in core profile
    contexts.

    \value VertexShaderPointSize Indicates that the size of rasterized points
    set via \c{gl_PointSize} in the vertex shader is taken into account. When
    reported as not supported, drawing points with a size other than 1 is not
    supported. Setting \c{gl_PointSize} in the shader is still valid then, but
    is ignored. (for example, when generating HLSL, the assignment is silently
    dropped from the generated code) Note that some APIs (Metal, Vulkan)
    require the point size to be set in the shader explicitly whenever drawing
    points, even when the size is 1, as they do not automatically default to 1.

    \value BaseVertex Indicates that
    \l{QRhiCommandBuffer::drawIndexed()}{drawIndexed()} supports the \c
    vertexOffset argument. When reported as not supported, the vertexOffset
    value in an indexed draw is ignored. In practice this feature will be
    unsupported with OpenGL and OpenGL ES versions lower than 3.2, and with
    Metal on older iOS devices, including the iOS Simulator.

    \value BaseInstance Indicates that instanced draw commands support the \c
    firstInstance argument. When reported as not supported, the firstInstance
    value is ignored and the instance ID starts from 0. In practice this feature
    will be unsupported with OpenGL, and with Metal on older iOS devices,
    including the iOS Simulator.

    \value TriangleFanTopology Indicates that QRhiGraphicsPipeline::setTopology()
    supports QRhiGraphicsPipeline::TriangleFan. In practice this feature will be
    unsupported with Metal and Direct 3D 11.

    \value ReadBackNonUniformBuffer Indicates that
    \l{QRhiResourceUpdateBatch::readBackBuffer()}{reading buffer contents} is
    supported for QRhiBuffer instances with a usage different than
    UniformBuffer. In practice this feature will be unsupported with OpenGL ES
    2.0.

    \value ReadBackNonBaseMipLevel Indicates that specifying a mip level other
    than 0 is supported when reading back texture contents. When not supported,
    specifying a non-zero level in QRhiReadbackDescription leads to returning
    an all-zero image. In practice this feature will be unsupported with OpenGL
    ES 2.0.

    \value TexelFetch Indicates that texelFetch() and textureLod() are available
    in shaders. In practice this will be reported as unsupported with OpenGL ES
    2.0 and OpenGL 2.x contexts, because GLSL 100 es and versions before 130 do
    not support these functions.

    \value RenderToNonBaseMipLevel Indicates that specifying a mip level other
    than 0 is supported when creating a QRhiTextureRenderTarget with a
    QRhiTexture as its color attachment. When not supported, create() will fail
    whenever the target mip level is not zero. In practice this feature will be
    unsupported with OpenGL ES 2.0.

    \value IntAttributes Indicates that specifying input attributes with
    signed and unsigned integer types for a shader pipeline is supported. When
    not supported, build() will succeed but just show a warning message and the
    values of the target attributes will be broken. In practice this feature
    will be unsupported with OpenGL ES 2.0 and OpenGL 2.x.

    \value ScreenSpaceDerivatives Indicates that functions such as dFdx(),
    dFdy(), and fwidth() are supported in shaders. In practice this feature will
    be unsupported with OpenGL ES 2.0 without the GL_OES_standard_derivatives
    extension.

    \value ReadBackAnyTextureFormat Indicates that reading back texture
    contents can be expected to work for any QRhiTexture::Format. Backends
    other than OpenGL can be expected to return true for this feature. When
    reported as false, which will typically happen with OpenGL, only the
    formats QRhiTexture::RGBA8 and QRhiTexture::BGRA8 are guaranteed to be
    supported for readbacks. In addition, with OpenGL, but not OpenGL ES,
    reading back the 1 byte per component formats QRhiTexture::R8 and
    QRhiTexture::RED_OR_ALPHA8 are supported as well. Reading back floating
    point formats QRhiTexture::RGBA16F and RGBA32F may work too with OpenGL, as
    long as the implementation provides support for these, but QRhi can give no
    guarantees, as indicated by this flag.

    \value PipelineCacheDataLoadSave Indicates that the pipelineCacheData() and
    setPipelineCacheData() functions are functional. When not supported, the
    functions will not perform any action, the retrieved blob is always empty,
    and thus no benefits can be expected from retrieving and, during a
    subsequent run of the application, reloading the pipeline cache content.

    \value ImageDataStride Indicates that specifying a custom stride (row
    length) for raw image data in texture uploads is supported. When not
    supported (which can happen when the underlying API is OpenGL ES 2.0 without
    support for GL_UNPACK_ROW_LENGTH),
    QRhiTextureSubresourceUploadDescription::setDataStride() must not be used.

    \value RenderBufferImport Indicates that QRhiRenderBuffer::createFrom() is
    supported. For most graphics APIs this is not sensible because
    QRhiRenderBuffer encapsulates texture objects internally, just like
    QRhiTexture. With OpenGL however, renderbuffer object exist as a separate
    object type in the API, and in certain environments (for example, where one
    may want to associated a renderbuffer object with an EGLImage object) it is
    important to allow wrapping an existing OpenGL renderbuffer object with a
    QRhiRenderBuffer.

    \value ThreeDimensionalTextures Indicates that 3D textures are supported.
    In practice this feature will be unsupported with OpenGL and OpenGL ES
    versions lower than 3.0.

    \value RenderTo3DTextureSlice Indicates that rendering to a slice in a 3D
    texture is supported. This can be unsupported with Vulkan 1.0 due to
    relying on VK_IMAGE_CREATE_2D_ARRAY_COMPATIBLE_BIT which is a Vulkan 1.1
    feature.

    Flag values for QRhi::endFrame()

    \value SkipPresent Specifies that no present command is to be queued or no

    multiple frames with all having this flag set is not recommended (except,
    for example, for benchmarking purposes - but keep in mind that backends may
    behave differently when it comes to waiting for command completion without
    presenting so the results are not comparable between them)
 */

/*!
    \enum QRhi::ResourceLimit
    Describes the resource limit to query.

    \value TextureSizeMin Minimum texture width and height. This is typically
    1. The minimum texture size is handled gracefully, meaning attempting to
    create a texture with an empty size will instead create a texture with the
    minimum size.

    \value TextureSizeMax Maximum texture width and height. This depends on the
    graphics API and sometimes the platform or implementation as well.
    Typically the value is in the range 4096 - 16384. Attempting to create
    textures larger than this is expected to fail.

    \value MaxColorAttachments The maximum number of color attachments for a
    QRhiTextureRenderTarget, in case multiple render targets are supported. When
    MRT is not supported, the value is 1. Otherwise this is typically 8, but
    watch out for the fact that OpenGL only mandates 4 as the minimum, and that
    is what some OpenGL ES implementations provide.

    \value FramesInFlight The number of frames the backend may keep "in
    flight": with backends like Vulkan or Metal, it is the responsibility of
    QRhi to block whenever starting a new frame and finding the CPU is already
    \c{N - 1} frames ahead of the GPU (because the command buffer submitted in
    frame no. \c{current} - \c{N} has not yet completed). The value N is what
    is returned from here, and is typically 2. This can be relevant to
    applications that integrate rendering done directly with the graphics API,
    as such rendering code may want to perform double (if the value is 2)
    buffering for resources, such as, buffers, similarly to the QRhi backends
    themselves. The current frame slot index (a value running 0, 1, .., N-1,
    then wrapping around) is retrievable from QRhi::currentFrameSlot(). The
    value is 1 for backends where the graphics API offers no such low level
    control over the command submission process. Note that pipelining may still
    happen even when this value is 1 (some backends, such as D3D11, are
    designed to attempt to enable this, for instance, by using an update
    strategy for uniform buffers that does not stall the pipeline), but that is
    then not controlled by QRhi and so not reflected here in the API.

    \value MaxAsyncReadbackFrames The number of \l{QRhi::endFrame()}{submitted}
    frames (including the one that contains the readback) after which an
    asynchronous texture or buffer readback is guaranteed to complete upon
    \l{QRhi::beginFrame()}{starting a new frame}.

    \value MaxThreadGroupsPerDimension The maximum number of compute
    work/thread groups that can be dispatched. Effectively the maximum value
    for the arguments of QRhiCommandBuffer::dispatch(). Typically 65535.

    \value MaxThreadsPerThreadGroup The maximum number of invocations in a
    single local work group, or in other terminology, the maximum number of
    threads in a thread group. Effectively the maximum value for the product of
    \c local_size_x, \c local_size_y, and \c local_size_z in the compute
    shader. Typical values are 128, 256, 512, 1024, or 1536. Watch out that
    both OpenGL ES and Vulkan specify only 128 as the minimum required limit
    for implementations. While uncommon for Vulkan, some OpenGL ES 3.1
    implementations for mobile/embedded devices only support the spec-mandated
    minimum value.

    \value MaxThreadGroupX The maximum size of a work/thread group in the X
    dimension. Effectively the maximum value of \c local_size_x in the compute
    shader. Typically 256 or 1024.

    \value MaxThreadGroupY The maximum size of a work/thread group in the Y
    dimension. Effectively the maximum value of \c local_size_y in the compute
    shader. Typically 256 or 1024.

    \value MaxThreadGroupZ The maximum size of a work/thread group in the Z
    dimension. Effectively the maximum value of \c local_size_z in the compute
    shader. Typically 64 or 256.

    \value MaxUniformBufferRange The number of bytes that can be exposed from a
    uniform buffer to the shaders at once. On OpenGL ES 2.0 and 3.0
    implementations this may be as low as 3584 bytes (224 four component, 32
    bits per component vectors). Elsewhere the value is typically 16384 (1024
    vec4s) or 65536 (4096 vec4s).

    \class QRhiVertexInputBinding
    \internal
    \inmodule QtGui
    \brief Describes a vertex input binding.

    Specifies the stride (in bytes, must be a multiple of 4), the
    classification and optionally the instance step rate.

    As an example, assume a vertex shader with the following inputs:

    \badcode
        layout(location = 0) in vec4 position;
        layout(location = 1) in vec2 texcoord;
    \endcode

    Now let's assume also that 3 component vertex positions \c{(x, y, z)} and 2
    component texture coordinates \c{(u, v)} are provided in a non-interleaved
    format in a buffer (or separate buffers even). Defining two bindings
    could then be done like this:

    \badcode
        QRhiVertexInputLayout inputLayout;
        inputLayout.setBindings({
            { 3 * sizeof(float) },
            { 2 * sizeof(float) }
        });
    \endcode

    Only the stride is interesting here since instancing is not used. The
    binding number is given by the index of the QRhiVertexInputBinding
    element in the bindings vector of the QRhiVertexInputLayout.

    Once a graphics pipeline with this vertex input layout is bound, the vertex
    inputs could be set up like the following for drawing a cube with 36
    vertices, assuming we have a single buffer with first the positions and
    then the texture coordinates:

    \badcode
        const QRhiCommandBuffer::VertexInput vbufBindings[] = {
            { cubeBuf, 0 },
            { cubeBuf, 36 * 3 * sizeof(float) }
        };
        cb->setVertexInput(0, 2, vbufBindings);
    \endcode

    Note how the index defined by \c {startBinding + i}, where \c i is the
    index in the second argument of
    \l{QRhiCommandBuffer::setVertexInput()}{setVertexInput()}, matches the
    index of the corresponding entry in the \c bindings vector of the
    QRhiVertexInputLayout.

    \note the stride must always be a multiple of 4.

    \class QRhiVertexInputAttribute
    \internal
    \inmodule QtGui
    \brief Describes a single vertex input element.

    The members specify the binding number, location, format, and offset for a
    single vertex input element.

    \note For HLSL it is assumed that the vertex shader uses
    \c{TEXCOORD<location>} as the semantic for each input. Hence no separate
    semantic name and index.

    As an example, assume a vertex shader with the following inputs:

    \badcode
        layout(location = 0) in vec4 position;
        layout(location = 1) in vec2 texcoord;
    \endcode

    Now let's assume that we have 3 component vertex positions \c{(x, y, z)}
    and 2 component texture coordinates \c{(u, v)} are provided in a
    non-interleaved format in a buffer (or separate buffers even). Once two
    bindings are defined, the attributes could be specified as:

    \badcode
        QRhiVertexInputLayout inputLayout;
        inputLayout.setBindings({
            { 3 * sizeof(float) },
            { 2 * sizeof(float) }
        });
        inputLayout.setAttributes({
            { 0, 0, QRhiVertexInputAttribute::Float3, 0 },
            { 1, 1, QRhiVertexInputAttribute::Float2, 0 }
        });
    \endcode

    Once a graphics pipeline with this vertex input layout is bound, the vertex
    inputs could be set up like the following for drawing a cube with 36
    vertices, assuming we have a single buffer with first the positions and
    then the texture coordinates:

    \badcode
        const QRhiCommandBuffer::VertexInput vbufBindings[] = {
            { cubeBuf, 0 },
            { cubeBuf, 36 * 3 * sizeof(float) }
        };
        cb->setVertexInput(0, 2, vbufBindings);
    \endcode

    When working with interleaved data, there will typically be just one
    binding, with multiple attributes referring to that same buffer binding
    point:

    \badcode
        QRhiVertexInputLayout inputLayout;
        inputLayout.setBindings({
            { 5 * sizeof(float) }
        });
        inputLayout.setAttributes({
            { 0, 0, QRhiVertexInputAttribute::Float3, 0 },
            { 0, 1, QRhiVertexInputAttribute::Float2, 3 * sizeof(float) }
        });
    \endcode

    and then:

    \badcode
        const QRhiCommandBuffer::VertexInput vbufBinding(interleavedCubeBuf, 0);
        cb->setVertexInput(0, 1, &vbufBinding);
    \endcode

    \sa QRhiCommandBuffer::setVertexInput()
 */

/*!

    \brief Describes the a single color attachment of a render target.

    A color attachment is either a QRhiTexture or a QRhiRenderBuffer. The
    former, when texture() is set, is used in most cases.

    \note texture() and renderBuffer() cannot be both set (be non-null at the
    same time).

    Setting renderBuffer instead is recommended only when multisampling is
    needed. Relying on QRhi::MultisampleRenderBuffer is a better choice than
    QRhi::MultisampleTexture in practice since the former is available in more
    run time configurations (e.g. when running on OpenGL ES 3.0 which has no
    support for multisample textures, but does support multisample
    renderbuffers).

    When targeting a non-multisample texture, the layer() and level() indicate
    the targeted layer (face index \c{0-5} for cubemaps) and mip level. For 3D
    textures layer() specifies the slice (one 2D image within the 3D texture)
    to render to.

    When texture() or renderBuffer() is multisample, resolveTexture() can be
    set optionally. When set, samples are resolved automatically into that
    (non-multisample) texture at the end of the render pass. When rendering
    into a multisample renderbuffers, this is the only way to get resolved,
    non-multisample content out of them. Multisample textures allow sampling in
    shaders so for them this is just one option.

    \note when resolving is enabled, the multisample data may not be written
    out at all. This means that the multisample texture() must not be used
    afterwards with shaders for sampling when resolveTexture() is set.

    \class QRhiTextureSubresourceUploadDescription
    \internal
    \inmodule QtGui
    \brief Describes the source for one mip level in a layer in a texture upload operation.

    The source content is specified either as a QImage or as a raw blob. The
    former is only allowed for uncompressed textures with a format that can be
    mapped to QImage, while the latter is supported for all formats, including
    floating point and compressed.

    \note image() and data() cannot be both set at the same time.

    destinationTopLeft() specifies the top-left corner of the target
    rectangle. Defaults to (0, 0).

    An empty sourceSize() (the default) indicates that size is assumed to be
    the size of the subresource. With QImage-based uploads this implies that
    the size of the source image() must match the subresource. When providing
    raw data instead, sufficient number of bytes must be provided in data().

    sourceTopLeft() is supported only for QImage-based uploads, and specifies
    the top-left corner of the source rectangle.

    \note Setting sourceSize() or sourceTopLeft() may trigger a QImage copy
    internally, depending on the format and the backend.

    When providing raw data, and the stride is not specified via
    setDataStride(), the stride (row pitch, row length in bytes) of the
    provided data must be equal to \c{width * pixelSize} where \c pixelSize is
    the number of bytes used for one pixel, and there must be no additional
    padding between rows. There is no row start alignment requirement.

    When there is unused data at the end of each row in the input raw data,
    call setDataStride() with the total number of bytes per row. The stride
    must always be a multiple of the number of bytes for one pixel. The row
    stride is only applicable to image data for textures with an uncompressed
    format.

    \note The format of the source data must be compatible with the texture
    format. With many graphics APIs the data is copied as-is into a staging
    buffer, there is no intermediate format conversion provided by QRhi. This
    applies to floating point formats as well, with, for example, RGBA16F
    requiring half floats in the source data.

    \note Setting the stride via setDataStride() is only functional when
    QRhi::ImageDataStride is reported as
    \l{QRhi::isFeatureSupported()}{supported}. In practice this can be expected
    to be supported everywhere except for OpenGL ES 2.0.

    \note When a QImage is given, the stride returned from
    QImage::bytesPerLine() is taken into account automatically.

    \warning When a QImage is given and the QImage does not own the underlying
    pixel data, it is up to the caller to ensure that the associated data stays
    valid until the end of the frame. (just submitting the resource update batch
    is not sufficient, the data must stay valid until QRhi::endFrame() is called
    in order to be portable across all backends) If this cannot be ensured, the
    caller is strongly encouraged to call QImage::detach() on the image before
    passing it to uploadTexture().

    \brief Describes a texture upload operation.

    Used with QRhiResourceUpdateBatch::uploadTexture(). That function has two
    variants: one taking a QImage and one taking a
    QRhiTextureUploadDescription. The former is a convenience version,
    internally creating a QRhiTextureUploadDescription with a single image
    targeting level 0 for layer 0. However, when cubemaps, pre-generated mip
    images, or compressed textures are involved, applications will have to work
    directly with this class instead.

    QRhiTextureUploadDescription also enables specifying batched uploads, which
    are useful for example when generating an atlas or glyph cache texture:
    multiple, partial uploads for the same subresource (meaning the same layer
    and level) are supported, and can be, depending on the backend and the
    underlying graphics API, more efficient when batched into the same
    QRhiTextureUploadDescription as opposed to issuing individual
    \l{QRhiResourceUpdateBatch::uploadTexture()}{uploadTexture()} commands for
    each of them.

    \note Cubemaps have one layer for each of the six faces in the order +X,
    -X, +Y, -Y, +Z, -Z.

    For example, specifying the faces of a cubemap could look like the following:

    \badcode
        QImage faces[6];
        ...
        QList<QRhiTextureUploadEntry> entries;
        for (int i = 0; i < 6; ++i)
          entries.append(QRhiTextureUploadEntry(i, 0, faces[i]));
        QRhiTextureUploadDescription desc(entries);
        resourceUpdates->uploadTexture(texture, desc);
    \endcode

    Another example that specifies mip images for a compressed texture:

    \badcode
        QRhiTextureUploadDescription desc;
        const int mipCount = rhi->mipLevelsForSize(compressedTexture->pixelSize());
        for (int level = 0; level < mipCount; ++level) {
            const QByteArray compressedDataForLevel = ..
            desc.append(QRhiTextureUploadEntry(0, level, compressedDataForLevel));
        }
        resourceUpdates->uploadTexture(compressedTexture, desc);
    \endcode

    Renderbuffers cannot be sampled or read but have some benefits over

    A DepthStencil renderbuffer may be lazily allocated and be backed by
    transient memory with some APIs. On some platforms this may mean the
    depth/stencil buffer uses no physical backing at all.

    Color renderbuffers are useful since QRhi::MultisampleRenderBuffer may be
    supported even when QRhi::MultisampleTexture is not.

    How the renderbuffer is implemented by a backend is not exposed to the
    applications. In some cases it may be backed by ordinary textures, while in
    others there may be a different kind of native resource used.

    Renderbuffers that are used as (and are only used as) depth-stencil buffers
    in combination with a QRhiSwapChain's color buffers should have the
    UsedWithSwapChainOnly flag set. This serves a double purpose: such buffers,
    depending on the backend and the underlying APIs, be more efficient, and

    The concept of the compatibility of renderpass descriptors is similar to
    the \l{QRhiShaderResourceBindings::isLayoutCompatible}{layout
    compatibility} of QRhiShaderResourceBindings instances. They allow better
    reuse of QRhiGraphicsPipeline instances: for example, a
    QRhiGraphicsPipeline instance cache is expected to use these functions to
    look for a matching pipeline, instead of just comparing pointers, thus
    allowing a different QRhiRenderPassDescriptor and
    QRhiShaderResourceBindings to be used in combination with the pipeline, as
    long as they are compatible.

    The exact details of compatibility depend on the underlying graphics API.
    Two renderpass descriptors
    \l{QRhiTextureRenderTarget::newCompatibleRenderPassDescriptor()}{created}
    from the same QRhiTextureRenderTarget are always compatible.

    Similarly to QRhiShaderResourceBindings, compatibility can also be tested
    without having two existing objects available. Extracting the opaque blob by
    calling serializedFormat() allows testing for compatibility by comparing the
    returned vector to another QRhiRenderPassDescriptor's
    serializedFormat(). This has benefits in certain situations, because it
    allows testing the compatibility of a QRhiRenderPassDescriptor with a
    QRhiGraphicsPipeline even when the QRhiRenderPassDescriptor the pipeline was
    originally built was is no longer available (but the data returned from its

    (in order to allow creating new pipelines which in turn requires a
    renderpass descriptor object), and the lifetime of the renderpass
    descriptor created from a render target may be shorter than the pipelines.
    (for example, because the engine manages and destroys renderpasses together
    with the textures and render targets it was created from) In such a

    \brief Encapsulates resources for making buffer, texture, sampler resources visible to shaders.

    A QRhiShaderResourceBindings is a collection of QRhiShaderResourceBinding
    objects, each of which describe a single binding.

    Take a fragment shader with the following interface:

    \badcode
        layout(std140, binding = 0) uniform buf {
            mat4 mvp;
            int flip;
        } ubuf;

        layout(binding = 1) uniform sampler2D tex;
    \endcode

    To make resources visible to the shader, the following
    QRhiShaderResourceBindings could be created and then passed to
    QRhiGraphicsPipeline::setShaderResourceBindings():

    \badcode
        srb = rhi->newShaderResourceBindings();
        srb->setBindings({
            QRhiShaderResourceBinding::uniformBuffer(0, QRhiShaderResourceBinding::VertexStage | QRhiShaderResourceBinding::FragmentStage, ubuf),
            QRhiShaderResourceBinding::sampledTexture(1, QRhiShaderResourceBinding::FragmentStage, texture, sampler)
        });
        srb->create();
        ...
        ps = rhi->newGraphicsPipeline();
        ...
        ps->setShaderResourceBindings(srb);
        ps->create();
        ...
        cb->setGraphicsPipeline(ps);
        cb->setShaderResources(); // binds srb
    \endcode

    This assumes that \c ubuf is a QRhiBuffer, \c texture is a QRhiTexture,
    while \a sampler is a QRhiSampler. The example also assumes that the
    uniform block is present in the vertex shader as well so the same buffer is
    made visible to the vertex stage too.

    \section3 Advanced usage

    Building on the above example, let's assume that a pass now needs to use
    the exact same pipeline and shaders with a different texture. Creating a
    whole separate QRhiGraphicsPipeline just for this would be an overkill.
    This is why QRhiCommandBuffer::setShaderResources() allows specifying a \a
    srb argument. As long as the layouts (so the number of bindings and the
    binding points) match between two QRhiShaderResourceBindings, they can both
    be used with the same pipeline, assuming the pipeline was created with one of
    them in the first place.

    \badcode
        srb2 = rhi->newShaderResourceBindings();
        ...
        cb->setGraphicsPipeline(ps);
        cb->setShaderResources(srb2); // binds srb2

    \class QRhiSwapChain
    \internal
    \inmodule QtGui
    \brief Swapchain resource.

    A swapchain enables presenting rendering results to a surface. A swapchain
    is typically backed by a set of color buffers. Of these, one is displayed
    at a time.

    Below is a typical pattern for creating and managing a swapchain and some
    associated resources in order to render onto a QWindow:

    \badcode
      void init()
      {
          sc = rhi->newSwapChain();
          ds = rhi->newRenderBuffer(QRhiRenderBuffer::DepthStencil,
                                    QSize(), // no need to set the size here due to UsedWithSwapChainOnly
                                    1,
                                    QRhiRenderBuffer::UsedWithSwapChainOnly);
          sc->setWindow(window);
          sc->setDepthStencil(ds);
          rp = sc->newCompatibleRenderPassDescriptor();
          sc->setRenderPassDescriptor(rp);
          resizeSwapChain();
      }

      void resizeSwapChain()
      {
          hasSwapChain = sc->createOrResize();
      }

      void render()
      {
          if (!hasSwapChain || notExposed)
              return;

          if (sc->currentPixelSize() != sc->surfacePixelSize() || newlyExposed) {
              resizeSwapChain();
              if (!hasSwapChain)
                  return;
              newlyExposed = false;
          }

          rhi->beginFrame(sc);
          // ...
          rhi->endFrame(sc);
      }
    \endcode

    Avoid relying on QWindow resize events to resize swapchains, especially
    considering that surface sizes may not always fully match the QWindow
    reported dimensions. The safe, cross-platform approach is to do the check
    via surfacePixelSize() whenever starting a new frame.

    Releasing the swapchain must happen while the QWindow and the underlying
    native window is fully up and running. Building on the previous example:

    \badcode
        void releaseSwapChain()
        {
            if (hasSwapChain) {
                sc->destroy();
                hasSwapChain = false;
            }
        }

        // assuming Window is our QWindow subclass
        bool Window::event(QEvent *e)
        {
            switch (e->type()) {
            case QEvent::UpdateRequest: // for QWindow::requestUpdate()
                render();
                break;
            case QEvent::PlatformSurface:
                if (static_cast<QPlatformSurfaceEvent *>(e)->surfaceEventType() == QPlatformSurfaceEvent::SurfaceAboutToBeDestroyed)
                    releaseSwapChain();
                break;
            default:
                break;
            }
            return QWindow::event(e);
        }
    \endcode

    Initializing the swapchain and starting to render the first frame cannot
    start at any time. The safe, cross-platform approach is to rely on expose
    events. QExposeEvent is a loosely specified event that is sent whenever a
    window gets mapped, obscured, and resized, depending on the platform.

    \badcode
        void Window::exposeEvent(QExposeEvent *)
        {
            // initialize and start rendering when the window becomes usable for graphics purposes
            if (isExposed() && !running) {
                running = true;
                init();
            }

            // stop pushing frames when not exposed or size becomes 0
            if ((!isExposed() || (hasSwapChain && sc->surfacePixelSize().isEmpty())) && running)
                notExposed = true;

            // continue when exposed again and the surface has a valid size
            if (isExposed() && running && notExposed && !sc->surfacePixelSize().isEmpty()) {
                notExposed = false;
                newlyExposed = true;
            }

            if (isExposed() && !sc->surfacePixelSize().isEmpty())
                render();
        }
    \endcode

    Once the rendering has started, a simple way to request a new frame is
    QWindow::requestUpdate(). While on some platforms this is merely a small
    timer, on others it has a specific implementation: for instance on macOS or
    iOS it may be backed by
    \l{https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corevideo/cvdisplaylink?language=objc}{CVDisplayLink}.
    The example above is already prepared for update requests by handling
    QEvent::UpdateRequest.

    While acting as a QRhiRenderTarget, QRhiSwapChain also manages a
    QRhiCommandBuffer. Calling QRhi::endFrame() submits the recorded commands
    and also enqueues a \c present request. The default behavior is to do this
    with a swap interval of 1, meaning synchronizing to the display's vertical
    refresh is enabled. Thus the rendering thread calling beginFrame() and
    endFrame() will get throttled to vsync. On some backends this can be
    disabled by passing QRhiSwapChain:NoVSync in flags().

    Multisampling (MSAA) is handled transparently to the applications when
    requested via setSampleCount(). Where applicable, QRhiSwapChain will take
    care of creating additional color buffers and issuing a multisample resolve
    command at the end of a frame. For OpenGL, it is necessary to request the
    appropriate sample count also via QSurfaceFormat, by calling
    QSurfaceFormat::setDefaultFormat() before initializing the QRhi.
 */

/*!
    \enum QRhiSwapChain::Flag
    Flag values to describe swapchain properties

    \value SurfaceHasPreMulAlpha Indicates that the target surface has
    transparency with premultiplied alpha. For example, this is what Qt Quick
    uses when the alpha channel is enabled on the target QWindow, because the
    scenegraph rendrerer always outputs fragments with alpha multiplied into
    the red, green, and blue values. To ensure identical behavior across
    platforms, always set QSurfaceFormat::alphaBufferSize() to a non-zero value
    on the target QWindow whenever this flag is set on the swapchain.

    \value SurfaceHasNonPreMulAlpha Indicates the target surface has
    transparency with non-premultiplied alpha. Be aware that this may not be
    supported on some systems, if the system compositor always expects content
    with premultiplied alpha. In that case the behavior with this flag set is
    expected to be equivalent to SurfaceHasPreMulAlpha.

    \value sRGB Requests to pick an sRGB format for the swapchain and/or its
    render target views, where applicable. Note that this implies that sRGB
    framebuffer update and blending will get enabled for all content targeting
    this swapchain, and opting out is not possible. For OpenGL, set
    \l{QSurfaceFormat::sRGBColorSpace}{sRGBColorSpace} on the QSurfaceFormat of
    the QWindow in addition.

    \value UsedAsTransferSource Indicates the swapchain will be used as the
    source of a readback in QRhiResourceUpdateBatch::readBackTexture().

    \value NoVSync Requests disabling waiting for vertical sync, also avoiding
    throttling the rendering thread. The behavior is backend specific and
    applicable only where it is possible to control this. Some may ignore the
    request altogether. For OpenGL, try instead setting the swap interval to 0
    on the QWindow via QSurfaceFormat::setSwapInterval().

    \value MinimalBufferCount Requests creating the swapchain with the minimum
    number of buffers, which is in practice 2, unless the graphics
    implementation has a higher minimum number than that. Only applicable with
    backends where such control is available via the graphics API, for example,
    Vulkan. By default it is up to the backend to decide what number of buffers
    it requests (in practice this is almost always either 2 or 3), and it is
    not the applications' concern. However, on Vulkan for instance the backend
    will likely prefer the higher number (3), for example to avoid odd
    performance issues with some Vulkan implementations on mobile devices. It
    could be that on some platforms it can prove to be beneficial to force the
    lower buffer count (2), so this flag allows forcing that. Note that all
    this has no effect on the number of frames kept in flight, so the CPU
    (QRhi) will still prepare frames at most \c{N - 1} frames ahead of the GPU,
    even when the swapchain image buffer count larger than \c N. (\c{N} =
    QRhi::FramesInFlight and typically 2).

    \return the size with which the swapchain was last successfully built. Use
    this to decide if createOrResize() needs to be called again: if
    \c{currentPixelSize() != surfacePixelSize()} then the swapchain needs to be
    resized.

    \note Typical rendering logic will call this function to get the output
    size when starting to prepare a new frame, and base dependent calculations
    (such as, the viewport) on the size returned from this function.

    While in many cases the value is the same as \c{QWindow::size() *
    QWindow::devicePixelRatio()}, relying on the QWindow-reported size is not
    guaranteed to be correct on all platforms and graphics API implementations.
    Using this function is therefore strongly recommended whenever there is a
    need to identify the dimensions, in pixels, of the output layer or surface.

    This also has the added benefit of avoiding potential data races when QRhi
    is used on a dedicated rendering thread, because the need to call QWindow
    functions, that may then access data updated on the main thread, is
    avoided.

/*!
    \fn QSize QRhiSwapChain::surfacePixelSize()

    \return The size of the window's associated surface or layer.

    \warning Do not assume this is the same as \c{QWindow::size() *
    QWindow::devicePixelRatio()}. With some graphics APIs and windowing system
    interfaces (for example, Vulkan) there is a theoretical possibility for a
    surface to assume a size different from the associated window. To support
    these cases, rendering logic must always base size-derived calculations
    (such as, viewports) on the size reported from QRhiSwapChain, and never on
    the size queried from QWindow.

    \note Can also be called before createOrResize(), if at least window() is
    already set) This in combination with currentPixelSize() allows to detect
    when a swapchain needs to be resized. However, watch out for the fact that
    the size of the underlying native object (surface, layer, or similar) is
    "live", so whenever this function is called, it returns the latest value
    reported by the underlying implementation, without any atomicity guarantee.
    Therefore, using this function to determine pixel sizes for graphics
    resources that are used in a frame is strongly discouraged. Rely on
    currentPixelSize() instead which returns a size that is atomic and will not
    change between createOrResize() invocations.

    \note For depth-stencil buffers used in combination with the swapchain's
    color buffers, it is strongly recommended to rely on the automatic sizing
    and rebuilding behavior provided by the
    QRhiRenderBuffer:UsedWithSwapChainOnly flag. Avoid querying the surface
    size via this function just to get a size that can be passed to
    QRhiRenderBuffer::setPixelSize() as that would suffer from the lack of
    atomicity as described above.

    What then happens under the hood is hidden from the application: the

    various different ways.

    A resource update batch owns no graphics resources and does not perform any

   \note The readback returns raw byte data, in order to allow the applications
   to interpret it in any way they see fit. Be aware of the blending settings

   the results of the readback must also be interpreted as Premultiplied.

   \note When interpreting the resulting raw data, be aware that the readback

    \a srb can be null in which case the current graphics or compute pipeline's
    associated QRhiShaderResourceBindings is used. When \a srb is non-null, it
    must be
    \l{QRhiShaderResourceBindings::isLayoutCompatible()}{layout-compatible},
    meaning the layout (number of bindings, the type and binding number of each
    binding) must fully match the QRhiShaderResourceBindings that was
    associated with the pipeline at the time of calling the pipeline's create().

    There are cases when a seemingly unnecessary setShaderResources() call is
    mandatory: when rebuilding a resource referenced from \a srb, for example
    changing the size of a QRhiBuffer followed by a QRhiBuffer::create(), this
    is the place where associated native objects (such as descriptor sets in
    case of Vulkan) are updated to refer to the current native resources that
    back the QRhiBuffer, QRhiTexture, QRhiSampler objects referenced from \a
    srb. In this case setShaderResources() must be called even if \a srb is
    the same as in the last call.

    When \a srb is not null, the QRhiShaderResourceBindings object the pipeline
    was built with in create() is guaranteed to be not accessed in any form. In
    fact, it does not need to be valid even at this point: destroying the
    pipeline's associated srb after create() and instead explicitly specifying
    another, \l{QRhiShaderResourceBindings::isLayoutCompatible()}{layout
    compatible} one in every setShaderResources() call is valid.

    \a dynamicOffsets allows specifying buffer offsets for uniform buffers that
    were associated with \a srb via
    QRhiShaderResourceBinding::uniformBufferWithDynamicOffset(). This is
    different from providing the offset in the \a srb itself: dynamic offsets
    do not require building a new QRhiShaderResourceBindings for every
    different offset, can avoid writing the underlying descriptors (with
    backends where applicable), and so they may be more efficient. Each element
    of \a dynamicOffsets is a \c binding - \c offset pair.
    \a dynamicOffsetCount specifies the number of elements in \a dynamicOffsets.

    \note All offsets in \a dynamicOffsets must be byte aligned to the value
    returned from QRhi::ubufAlignment().

    \note Some backends may limit the number of supported dynamic offsets.
    Avoid using a \a dynamicOffsetCount larger than 8.

    the conditions described above into account), so therefore overoptimizing
    to avoid calls to this function is not necessary on the applications' side.

    The index buffer used by subsequent drawIndexed() commands is specified by
    \a indexBuf, \a indexOffset, and \a indexFormat. \a indexBuf can be set to
    null when indexed drawing is not needed.

    Vertex buffer bindings are batched. \a startBinding specifies the first
    binding number. The recorded command then binds each buffer from \a
    bindings to the binding point \c{startBinding + i} where \c i is the index
    in \a bindings. Each element in \a bindings specifies a QRhiBuffer and an
    offset.

    \note Some backends may limit the number of vertex buffer bindings. Avoid
    using a \a bindingCount larger than 8.

    Superfluous vertex input and index changes in the same pass are ignored
    automatically with most backends and therefore applications do not need to
    overoptimize to avoid calls to this function.

    \note This function can only be called inside a render pass, meaning
    between a beginPass() and endPass() call.

    As a simple example, take a vertex shader with two inputs:

    \badcode
        layout(location = 0) in vec4 position;
        layout(location = 1) in vec3 color;
    \endcode

    and assume we have the data available in interleaved format, using only 2
    floats for position (so 5 floats per vertex: x, y, r, g, b). A QRhiGraphicsPipeline for
    this shader can then be created using the input layout:

    \badcode
        QRhiVertexInputLayout inputLayout;
        inputLayout.setBindings({
            { 5 * sizeof(float) }

            { 0, 1, QRhiVertexInputAttribute::Float3, 2 * sizeof(float) }
        });
    \endcode

    Here there is one buffer binding (binding number 0), with two inputs
    referencing it. When recording the pass, once the pipeline is set, the
    vertex bindings can be specified simply like the following (using C++11
    initializer syntax), assuming vbuf is the QRhiBuffer with all the
    interleaved position+color data:

    \badcode
        const QRhiCommandBuffer::VertexInput vbufBinding(vbuf, 0);
        cb->setVertexInput(0, 1, &vbufBinding);

    The loss of the device is typically detected in beginFrame(), endFrame() or
    QRhiSwapChain::createOrResize(), depending on the backend and the underlying
    native APIs. The most common is endFrame() because that is where presenting
    happens. With some backends QRhiSwapChain::createOrResize() can also fail
    due to a device loss. Therefore this function is provided as a generic way
    to check if a device loss was detected by a previous operation.

    When the device is lost, no further operations should be done via the QRhi.
    Rather, all QRhi resources should be released, followed by destroying the
    QRhi. A new QRhi can then be attempted to be created. If successful, all
    graphics resources must be reinitialized. If not, try again later,
    repeatedly.

    While simple applications may decide to not care about device loss,
    on the commonly used desktop platforms a device loss can happen
    due to a variety of reasons, including physically disconnecting the
    graphics adapter, disabling the device or driver, uninstalling or upgrading
    the graphics driver, or due to errors that lead to a graphics device reset.
    Some of these can happen under perfectly normal circumstances as well, for
    example the upgrade of the graphics driver to a newer version is a common
    task that can happen at any time while a Qt application is running. Users
    may very well expect applications to be able to survive this, even when the
    application is actively using an API like OpenGL or Direct3D.

    Qt's own frameworks built on top of QRhi, such as, Qt Quick, can be
    expected to handle and take appropriate measures when a device loss occurs.
    If the data for graphics resources, such as textures and buffers, are still
    available on the CPU side, such an event may not be noticeable on the
    application level at all since graphics resources can seamlessly be
    reinitialized then. However, applications and libraries working directly
    with QRhi are expected to be prepared to check and handle device loss
    situations themselves.

    \note With OpenGL, applications may need to opt-in to context reset
    notifications by setting QSurfaceFormat::ResetNotification on the
    QOpenGLContext. This is typically done by enabling the flag in
    QRhiGles2InitParams::format. Keep in mind however that some systems may
    generate context resets situations even when this flag is not set.

    object backing a QRhiBuffer with type QRhiBuffer::Dynamic) exist in
    multiple versions, so that each frame, that can be submitted while a
    previous one is still being processed, works with its own copy, thus
    avoiding the need to stall the pipeline when preparing the frame. (The
    contents of a resource that may still be in use in the GPU should not be
    touched, but simply always waiting for the previous frame to finish would
    reduce GPU utilization and ultimately, performance and efficiency.)

    Conceptually this is somewhat similar to copy-on-write schemes used by some
    C++ containers and other types. It may also be similar to what an OpenGL or
    Direct 3D 11 implementation performs internally for certain type of objects.

    In practice, such double (or triple) buffering resources is realized in
    the Vulkan, Metal, and similar QRhi backends by having a fixed number of
    native resource (such as, VkBuffer) \c slots behind a QRhiResource. That
    can then be indexed by a frame slot index running 0, 1, ..,
    FramesInFlight-1, and then wrapping around.

    All this is managed transparently to the users of QRhi. However,
    applications that integrate rendering done directly with the graphics API
    may want to perform a similar double or triple buffering of their own
    graphics resources. That is then most easily achieved by knowing the values
    of the maximum number of in-flight frames (retrievable via resourceLimit())
    and the current frame (slot) index (returned by this function).

/*!
    Starts a new offscreen frame. Provides a command buffer suitable for
    recording rendering commands in \a cb. \a flags is used to indicate
    certain special cases, just like with beginFrame().

    \note The QRhiCommandBuffer stored to *cb is not owned by the caller.

    Rendering without a swapchain is possible as well. The typical use case is
    to use it in completely offscreen applications, e.g. to generate image
    sequences by rendering and reading back without ever showing a window.

    Usage in on-screen applications (so beginFrame, endFrame,
    beginOffscreenFrame, endOffscreenFrame, beginFrame, ...) is possible too
    but it does reduce parallelism so it should be done only infrequently.

    Offscreen frames do not let the CPU - potentially - generate another frame
    while the GPU is still processing the previous one. This has the side
    effect that if readbacks are scheduled, the results are guaranteed to be
    available once endOffscreenFrame() returns. That is not the case with
    frames targeting a swapchain.

    The skeleton of rendering a frame without a swapchain and then reading the
    frame contents back could look like the following:

    \badcode
          QRhiReadbackResult rbResult;
          QRhiCommandBuffer *cb;

          endPass(u);
