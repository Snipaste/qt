/*!
    \class QInputDevice
    \brief The QInputDevice class describes a device from which a QInputEvent originates.
    \since 6.0
    \inmodule QtGui

    Each QInputEvent contains a QInputDevice pointer to allow accessing
    device-specific properties like type, capabilities and seat. It is the
    responsibility of the platform or generic plug-ins to discover, create and
    register an instance of this class corresponding to each available input
    device, via QWindowSystemInterface::registerInputDevice(), before
    generating any input event referring to that device.

    Applications do not need to instantiate this class, but can read the
    instances pointed to by QInputEvent::device() and QInputDevice::devices().
*/

/*!
    \enum QInputDevice::Capability

    Indicates what kind of information the input device or its driver can
    provide.

    \value None
           No information about input device capabilities available.

    \value Position
           Indicates that position information is available, meaning that the
           position() family of functions in the touch points return valid points.

    \value Area
           Indicates that touch area information is available, meaning that
           QEventPoint::ellipseDiameters() in the touch points return valid
           values.

    \value Pressure
           Indicates that pressure information is available, meaning that
           QEventPoint::pressure() returns a valid value.

    \value Velocity
           Indicates that velocity information is available, meaning that
           QEventPoint::velocity() returns a valid vector.

    \value NormalizedPosition
           Indicates that the normalized position is available, meaning that
           QEventPoint::globalPosition() returns a valid value.

    \value MouseEmulation
           Indicates that the device synthesizes mouse events.

    \value Scroll
           Indicates that the device has a scroll capability.

    \value PixelScroll \since 6.2
           Indicates that the device (usually a
           \l {QInputDevice::DeviceType::TouchPad}{touchpad})
           scrolls with \l {QWheelEvent::pixelDelta()}{pixel precision}.

    \value Hover
           Indicates that the device has a hover capability.

    \value Rotation
           Indicates that \l {QEventPoint::}{rotation} information is available.

    \value XTilt
           Indicates that \l {QTabletEvent::xTilt()}{tilt} information is
           available for the X-axis.

    \value YTilt
           Indicates that \l {QTabletEvent::yTilt()}{tilt} information is
           available for the Y-axis.

    \value TangentialPressure
           Indicates that \l {QTabletEvent::tangentialPressure()}
           {tangential pressure} information is  available.

    \value ZPosition
           Indicates that position information for the \l {QTabletEvent::z()}
           {Z-axis} is available.

    \value All

    Creates a new input device instance. The given \a name is normally a

    identifiable; \a id is a platform-specific number that will be unique per
    device (for example the xinput ID on X11); \a type identifies what kind of
    device. On window systems that are capable of handling input from multiple
    users or sets of input devices at the same time (such as Wayland or X11),
    \a seatName identifies the name of the set of devices that will be used
    together. If the device is a child or slave device (for example one of
    several mice that can take turns moving the "core pointer"), the master
    device should be given as the \a parent.

    The platform plugin creates, registers and continues to own each device
    instance; usually \a parent should be given for memory management purposes
    even if there is no master for a particular device.

    By default, capabilities() are \c None.
