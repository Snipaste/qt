    \title Testing \PROD output from .qdoc files
    \brief This is a simple page for testing purposes only.

    QDoc generates documentation for software projects. It does this by
    extracting \e {QDoc comments} from project source files. QDoc comments are
    signified by a C-style-like comment tag followed by an exclamation point,
    like this:
    \beginqdoc \c {This text is contained within QDoc comment tags.} \endqdoc.

    \section1 Supported file types
    QDoc parses \c .cpp and \c .qdoc files. It does extract comments from
    header (\c {.h}) files.

    \section1 Further information
    This test document is written with the purpose of testing the output QDoc
    generates when parsing \c .qdoc files. It is fairly simple and makes use of
    a limited subset of QDoc's command. Those commands are:
    \list
        \li \c {\page}
        \li \c {\title}
        \li \c {\brief}
        \li \c {\e} (for emphasizing "QDoc comments")
        \li \c {\c} (for multiple monospace-formatted entries)
        \li \c {\section1}
        \li \c {\list}
        \li \c {\li}
        \li \c {\endlist}
    \endlist

    \section1 Linking

    There are multiple ways to create hyperlinks to other topics:

    \list
    \li \l {Testing QDoc's link command}{Linking to a page title}
    \li \l {Link targets}{Linking to a section title}
    \li \l {link-test-target}{Linking using a \\target string}
    \li \l {QDoc Linking Test}{Linking using a \\keyword string}
    \endlist

    \target link-test-target
    \section1 Link targets

    Valid parameters for the link command (\c {\l}) are page and section
    titles, targets defined with \\target or \\keyword commands, and API
    reference keywords (types, methods, namespaces, and so on).
