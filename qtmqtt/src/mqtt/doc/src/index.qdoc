    \title Qt MQTT
    \brief Provides classes and functions to make MQTT programming simple and
    portable.

    \l{MQTT} is a machine-to-machine (M2M) protocol utilizing the
    publish-and-subscribe paradigm. Its purpose is to provide a channel with
    minimal communication overhead.

    Generally, MQTT is used on top of a TCP connection. However, the base
    requirement is defined as an ordered, lossless, bidirectional connection.

    The Qt MQTT module provides a standard compliant implementation of the MQTT
    protocol specification. It enables applications to act as telemetry displays
    and devices to publish telemetry data. The supported versions are MQTT 3.1,
    MQTT 3.1.1, and MQTT 5.0.
