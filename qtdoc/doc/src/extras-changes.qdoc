    \title Changes to Qt Extras Modules
    \brief Migrate away from Extras Modules
    \ingroup changes-qt-5-to-6

    Qt 6 is a result of the conscious effort to make the framework more
    efficient and easy to use.

    We try to maintain binary and source compatibility for all the public
    APIs in each release. But some changes were inevitable in an effort to
    make Qt a better framework.

    One of those changes was to remove the platform-specific Extras modules,
    to ensure a cohesive cross-platform story and future for Qt 6. Most of the
    the functionality offered by these modules are replaced by a similar functionality
    in other Qt modules. This guide summarizes those alternatives, and provides guidance
    for the cases where Qt does not offer a replacement API.

    \section1 Changes to Qt Mac Extras

    \section2 QtMac namespace

    Most members of the QtMac namespace have \qt5{qtmac-obsolete.html}
    {explicit replacements}. The \qt5{qtmac-obsolete.html#fromCGImageRef}
    {\c QtMac::fromCGImageRef} function has been removed due to lack of
    known clients of the API.

    \section2 QMacPasteboardMime

    The \qt5{qmacpasteboardmime.html}{\c QMacPasteboardMime} class has been
    removed due to warranting a cross-platform solution. See \qtbug QTBUG-93632
    for details.

    \section2 QMacToolBar

    The \qt5{qmactoolbar.html}{\c QMacToolBar} and \qt5{qmactoolbaritem.html}
    {\c QMacToolBarItem} classes have been removed. Use QToolBar as a replacement.

    \section1 Changes to Qt Windows Extras

    \section2 QtWin namespace

    Many members of the QtWin namespace have \qt5{qtwin-obsolete.html}
    {explicit replacements}. To use these replacements with Qt Widgets
    or Qt Quick, operate on the QWindow representation of the relevant
    widget or control.

    The remaining functions have been removed:

    \section3 errorStringFromHresult

    Only used internally in WinExtras. No other known clients of the API.

    \section3 colorizationColor/isCompositionOpaque

    Concept exists on other platforms (tint/accent color). Warrants new
    cross-platform API, for example a new QPalette role or platform theme
    property.

    \section3 setWindowFlip3DPolicy

    Windows 7 feature. No longer supported in Windows 10.

    \section3 extendFrameIntoClientArea

    Similar functionality exists on other platforms. Warrants cross-platform
    QWindow API to control the relationship between the client area and the non-client area
    (frame/titlebar). See \qtbug QTBUG-94010 for details.

    \section3 enableBlurBehind

    Deprecated as of Windows 8.

    \section3 taskbarActivateTab and taskbar(Add/Delete)Tab

    No known clients of the API.

    \section2 QWinMime

    The \qt5{qwinmime.html}{\c QWinMime} class has been removed due to
    warranting a cross-platform solution. See \qtbug QTBUG-93632 for details.

    Clients that still rely on the functionality can include the private headers
    \c {<QtGui/private/qtguiapplication_p.h>} and \c {<QtGui/private/qwindowsmime_p.h>}
    and use the QWindowsApplication native interface to register new MIME types.
    To enable private headers use \c {QT += gui-private} with \c qmake,
    or add a project dependency to \c Qt::GuiPrivate with \c CMake.

    \section2 QWinJumpList

    The \qt5{qwinjumplist.html}{\c QWinJumpList}, \qt5{qwinjumplistcategory.html}
    {\c QWinJumpListCategory}, and \qt5{qwinjumplistitem.html}{\c QWinJumpListItem}
    classes have been removed due to warranting a cross-platform solution.
    See \qtbug QTBUG-94007 for details.

    \section2 QWinTaskbarButton

    The \qt5{qwintaskbarbutton.html}{\c QWinTaskbarButton} and \qt5{qwintaskbarprogress.html}
    {\c QWinTaskbarProgress} classes have been removed due to warranting a cross-platform
    solution. See \qtbug QTBUG-94009 and \qtbug QTBUG-94008 for details.

    \section2 QWinThumbnailToolBar

    The \qt5{qwinthumbnailtoolbar.html}{\c QWinThumbnailToolBar} and
    \qt5{qwinthumbnailtoolbutton.html}{\c QWinThumbnailToolButton}
    classes have been removed due to lack of known clients of the API.

    \section1 Changes to Qt X11 Extras

    The \qt5{qx11info.html}{\c QX11Info} class has been removed.

    Clients that still rely on the functionality can include the private
    header \c {<QtGui/private/qtx11extras_p.h>} as a stopgap solution.
    To enable private headers use \c {QT += gui-private} with \c qmake,
    or add a project dependency to \c Qt::GuiPrivate with \c CMake.

    \section1 Changes to Qt Android Extras

    Key functionality from the module has been brought over to other
    Qt modules.

    Clients that still rely on missing functionality can include the private
    header \c {<QtGui/private/qtandroidextras_p.h>} as a stopgap solution.
    To enable private headers use \c {QT += core-private} with \c qmake,
    or add a project dependency to \c Qt::CorePrivate with \c CMake.

    \section2 QAndroidJniObject and QAndroidJniEnvironment

    The \qt5{qandroidjniobject.html}{\c QAndroidJniObject} and
    \qt5{qandroidjnienvironment.html}{\c QAndroidJniEnvironment}
    classes have been replaced by \l QJniObject and \l QJniEnvironment
    respectively.

    The \qt5{qandroidjniexceptioncleaner.html}{\c QAndroidJniExceptionCleaner}
    class is no longer needed. See QJniEnvironment::checkAndClearExceptions()
    for a replacement.

    \section2 QtAndroid namespace

    Many members of the QtAndroid namespace have replacements in the
    \l {QNativeInterface::}{QAndroidApplication} native interface.
