\title User Interfaces
\brief Qt's technologies for Creating User Interfaces

The Qt framework's main user interface technologies are \b{Qt Quick Controls}
and \b{Qt Widgets}. Qt Quick Control interfaces are fluid, dynamic, and are best
on touch interfaces. Qt Widgets are for creating complex desktop applications.
You can create Qt Quick Controls and Qt Widgets interfaces with the target
platform's native look and feel.

\section1 Building UIs with Qt Quick Controls

Qt Quick Controls is for creating dynamic and fluid user interfaces. The
\l{Qt Quick Controls} module supplies QML types such as buttons, dialogs, and
menus. You can use QML, a declarative language, to build the UI and JavaScript
to implement the logic.

\li \l{Qt Shader Tools} - add-on shader effects
\endlist

\section1 Qt Widgets User Interfaces

\l {Qt Widgets} are the user interface elements that are typical in desktop
environments. The widgets integrate well to the underlying platform providing
native look and feel on Windows, Linux and \macos. The widgets are
mature and feature rich user interface elements suitable for mostly traditional
user interfaces. In contrast to \l {Qt Quick}, the widgets are for creating
large desktop applications and less suited for creating touch-centric
applications with fluid interfaces.

\li \l{Styles and Style Aware Widgets}
\endlist

\section2 Comparison of UI Interfaces

The following table compares Qt Widgets and Qt Quick interfaces.

\table

        \li Qt Widgets
        \li Comments

        \li \inlineimage ok
        \li Qt Widgets and Qt Quick Controls support native look and feel on
            their target platforms.
    \row
        \li Custom styling
        \li \inlineimage ok
        \li \inlineimage ok
        \li Qt Widgets provide customization with
            \l{Qt Style Sheets}{style sheets} and Qt Quick Controls has a
            selection of \l{Styling Qt Quick Controls}{customizable styles}.
    \row
        \li Fluid animated UIs
        \li \inlineimage ok
        \li
        \li Qt Widgets do not scale well for animations. Qt Quick Controls
            offers a convenient and natural way to implement animations in a
            declarative manner.
    \row
        \li Touch screen
        \li \inlineimage ok
        \li
        \li Qt Widgets often require a mouse cursor for good interaction, whereas
            Qt Quick Controls provides QML types for touch interaction.
    \row
        \li Standard industry widgets
        \li
        \li \inlineimage ok
        \li Qt Widgets provide all the bells and whistles, developed over two
            decades, needed for building standard industry type applications.
    \row
        \li Model/View programming
        \li \inlineimage ok
        \li \inlineimage ok
        \li Qt Quick provides convenient views, but Qt Widgets provide more
            convenient and complete framework. In addition to Qt Quick views,
            Qt Quick Controls provide a TableView.
    \row
        \li Rapid UI development
        \li \inlineimage ok
        \li \inlineimage ok
        \li Qt Quick is an excellent choice for rapid UI prototyping and development.
    \row
        \li HW accelerated graphics
        \li \inlineimage ok
        \li \inlineimage ok
        \li Qt provides full hardware acceleration for Qt Quick interfaces and
            Qt Widgets interfaces are rendered in software. The \l{Graphics}
            overview has more information.
    \row
        \li Graphical effects
        \li \inlineimage ok
        \li
        \li Several Qt Quick modules provide graphical effects and Qt Widgets
            interfaces can use \l{Qt GUI} for effects.
    \row
        \li Rich text processing
        \li \inlineimage ok
        \li \inlineimage ok
        \li Qt Widgets currently provide the most comprehensive base for implementing
            text editors. Qt's rich text document classes can also be utilized in
            Qt Quick and Qt Quick Controls' TextArea, but may require some C++
            implementation.
