    From Qt 5.9 onwards, the Green Hills Software
    \l {http://www.ghs.com/products/rtos/integrity.html} {INTEGRITY}
    Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) is a supported platform.

    The INTEGRITY RTOS is widely used in systems where safety and security are critical.
    Especially in the automotive industry, both Qt and the INTEGRITY RTOS can be
    used in conjunction with the instrument clusters and infotainment systems.

    With Qt for INTEGRITY you can build and develop applications for the
    INTEGRITY RTOS. The development environment includes your target device and Qt sources
    that you need to build for your target device.
    See \l {Supported Development Hosts and Target Boards} for detailed information
    about the supported development environment.

    Qt for INTEGRITY has a tutorial that helps you learn how to:
    \list
        \li Set up a development environment for the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8155P board
        \li Build an application
        \li Prepare the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8155P board to run your application
    \endlist

    See \l {Monolith Project Tutorial}.
