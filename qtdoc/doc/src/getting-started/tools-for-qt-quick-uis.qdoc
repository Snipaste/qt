    \title Tools for Qt Quick UIs
    \brief Tools for designing Qt Quick UIs.

    \image qtdesignstudio.png "Qt Design Studio"

    Qt provides a tool for designing Qt Quick UIs called
    \l{Qt Design Studio Manual}{Qt Design Studio}. You need
    to separately select Qt Design Studio in the list of modules
    and tools presented to you by the Qt installer.

    If you only design UIs and don't need the developer tools, you can install
    the stand-alone Qt Design Studio package. It contains all the Qt modules
    and tools you need to design UIs and preview them on the desktop. The
    Qt Quick code is automatically generated for you, and you can deliver it
    to developers for implementing the application. Developers can open the
    project in a developer tool called \l{Qt Creator Manual}{Qt Creator}.

    \list
        \li \l{Install Qt Design Studio}{I just want Qt Design Studio}
        \li \l{Get and Install Qt}{I want Qt and Qt Design Studio}
        \li \l{Create Your First Applications}
            {I've already installed everything and want to start designing}
    \endlist
