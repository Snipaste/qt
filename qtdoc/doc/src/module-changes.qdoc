\title Changes to Qt Modules in Qt 6
\brief A list of changes to Qt modules

Qt 6 is a result of the conscious effort to make the framework more
efficient and easy to use.

We try to maintain binary and source compatibility for all the public APIs in
each release, but some changes were inevitable in an effort to make Qt a
better framework. Below you can find a list of changes that may affect your
application, and which can help you transitioning from Qt 5 to Qt 6.

For information about changes specific to a Qt 6 release, visit the
\l{New Features by Qt Version} section.
