    \brief Can be used to provide an alternate GeometryView used only for picking.

    Picking can be an expensive operation, especially if the mesh has a lot of vertices.
    PickProxy can be used to provide an alternative geometry, usually with fewer primitives,
    which will be used for picking, while the GeometryRenderer instance will be used
    for rendering.

    \note Do not use a PickingProxy if the application requires picking coordinates
    to match the rendered mesh.

    \note The picking algorithm uses a bounding volume hierarchy to optimize out
    entities who's bounding volume does not intersect the picking ray. For that hierarchy,
    the bounding volume of the renderered entity is used (or one explicitly set using a
    BoundingVolume component) will be used rather than the one of the proxy.
